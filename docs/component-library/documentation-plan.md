## Documentation Workflow

Each component will be documented following the systematic component documentation workflow:

1. **Day 1: Initial Documentation**
   - Initialize component documentation using the template
   - Document purpose and specifications
   - Create interactive examples
   - Document props/API

2. **Day 2: Complete Documentation**
   - Document accessibility features
   - Create version compatibility matrix
   - Conduct technical debt review
   - Validate documentation

3. **Day 3: Peer Review**
   - Submit for peer review
   - Address feedback
   - Update documentation

4. **Day 4: Final Approval**
   - Submit for final approval
   - Merge documentation into main branch

## Documentation Tools

The following tools are used for the documentation process:

- **initialize-documentation.js**: Creates initial documentation from template
- **validate-documentation.js**: Validates documentation against checklist requirements
- **update-progress.js**: Updates the documentation progress tracker
- **document-component.sh**: Master script for the entire workflow

## Documentation Standards

All component documentation must adhere to the following standards:

1. **Completeness**: All required sections must be present
2. **Accuracy**: Documentation must match the actual implementation
3. **Clarity**: Documentation must be clear and easy to understand
4. **Examples**: Documentation must include working examples
5. **Accessibility**: Documentation must include accessibility information
6. **Technical Debt**: Documentation must include technical debt assessment

## Progress Tracking

Progress will be tracked using the documentation-progress.md file, which will be updated automatically by the workflow tools. Weekly progress reports will be generated and shared with the team.

## Quality Assurance

The following quality assurance measures will be implemented:

1. **Automated Validation**: All documentation will be validated against the checklist
2. **Peer Review**: All documentation will be reviewed by at least one other developer
3. **Final Approval**: All documentation will be approved by the Frontend Lead
4. **Continuous Improvement**: The documentation process will be continuously improved based on feedback

## Conclusion

This documentation plan provides a structured approach to documenting all components in the Hypatia Modern codebase. By following this plan, we will ensure that all components are documented thoroughly and consistently, providing a valuable resource for developers working on the project.

The plan is based on the actual components in the codebase and prioritizes them based on their usage frequency, complexity, and importance to the application. The documentation process follows a systematic workflow that ensures high-quality documentation for all components.
