    { id: 'ca', name: 'Canada' }
  ]}
  helper="Helper text"
  errorMessage="Error message"
  isRequired={true}
  isDisabled={true}
  onSelectChange={handleChange}
/>

// New usage (2.0)
<Select
  size="medium"
  variant="standard"
  options={[
    { value: 'us', label: 'United States' },
    { value: 'ca', label: 'Canada' }
  ]}
  helperText="Helper text"
  error="Error message"
  required={true}
  disabled={true}
