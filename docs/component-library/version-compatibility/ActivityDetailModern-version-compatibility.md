## Breaking Changes

### Version 2.0.0

The component was refactored to TypeScript in version 2.0.0, which introduced the following breaking changes:

1. **Stricter Type Checking**: Props are now strictly typed, so passing incorrect prop types will result in TypeScript errors
2. **React 16.8+ Required**: The component now uses React hooks, requiring React 16.8 or higher
3. **Redux Store Structure**: The component expects activities to be in a specific location in the Redux store

## Migration Guides

### Migrating from 1.x to 2.0

```jsx
// No code changes required for usage, but the Redux store structure must match:
// state.activities = {
//   activities: Activity[],
//   currentActivity: Activity | null,
//   loading: boolean,
//   error: string | null
// }

// Make sure your Redux actions are properly typed:
const fetchActivity = (
  activityId: string, 
  moduleId: string, 
  courseId: string
) => {
  // Implementation
};
```
