## Breaking Changes

### Version 2.0.0

The component was refactored to TypeScript in version 2.0.0, which introduced the following breaking changes:

1. **Stricter Type Checking**: Props are now strictly typed, so passing incorrect prop types will result in TypeScript errors
2. **React 16.8+ Required**: The component now uses React hooks, requiring React 16.8 or higher
3. **Position Prop Values**: The position prop now accepts a specific set of values ('top-right', 'top-left', etc.) instead of any string

## Migration Guides

### Migrating from 1.x to 2.0

```jsx
// Old usage (1.x)
<NotificationModern 
  type="success"
  message="Operation completed"
  position="topRight"
/>

// New usage (2.0)
<NotificationModern 
  type="success"
  message="Operation completed"
  position="top-right" // Note the hyphen in position values
/>
```
