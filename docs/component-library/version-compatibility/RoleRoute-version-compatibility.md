## Breaking Changes

### Version 1.2.0

The component was updated to work with React Router v6 in version 1.2.0, which introduced the following breaking changes:

1. **React Router API Changes**: The component now uses the `Navigate` component instead of the `Redirect` component
2. **Element Prop**: The component now works with the `element` prop in Route components instead of being used as a wrapper

### Version 2.0.0

The component was refactored to TypeScript in version 2.0.0, which introduced the following breaking changes:

1. **Stricter Type Checking**: Props are now strictly typed, so passing incorrect prop types will result in TypeScript errors
2. **React 16.8+ Required**: The component now uses React hooks, requiring React 16.8 or higher
3. **RoleRouteProps Interface**: The component now requires a specific RoleRouteProps interface for type checking

## Migration Guides

### Migrating from React Router v5 to v6

```jsx
// Before (React Router v5)
<Route path="/admin">
  <RoleRoute roles={['admin']}>
    <AdminDashboard />
  </RoleRoute>
</Route>

// After (React Router v6)
<Route
  path="/admin"
  element={
    <RoleRoute roles={['admin']}>
      <AdminDashboard />
    </RoleRoute>
  }
/>
```

### Migrating from JavaScript to TypeScript

```jsx
// Before (JavaScript)
import React from 'react';
import { Navigate, useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';
import { useAuthContext } from '../../contexts/AuthContext';
import LoadingSpinner from '../common/LoadingSpinner';

const RoleRoute = ({ children, roles }) => {
  const { isAuthenticated, hasRole, loading } = useAuthContext();
  const location = useLocation();
  
  if (loading) {
    return <LoadingSpinner message="Checking permissions..." />;
  }
  
  if (!isAuthenticated()) {
    return <Navigate to="/signin" state={{ from: location.pathname }} replace />;
  }
  
  if (!hasRole(roles)) {
    return <Navigate to="/dashboard" replace />;
  }
  
  return <>{children}</>;
};

export default RoleRoute;

// After (TypeScript)
import React from 'react';
import { Navigate, useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';
import { useAuthContext } from '../../contexts/AuthContext';
import LoadingSpinner from '../common/LoadingSpinner';

interface RoleRouteProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  roles: string[];
}

const RoleRoute: React.FC<RoleRouteProps> = ({ children, roles }) => {
  const { isAuthenticated, hasRole, loading } = useAuthContext();
  const location = useLocation();
  
  if (loading) {
    return <LoadingSpinner message="Checking permissions..." />;
  }
  
  if (!isAuthenticated()) {
    return <Navigate to="/signin" state={{ from: location.pathname }} replace />;
  }
  
  if (!hasRole(roles)) {
    return <Navigate to="/dashboard" replace />;
  }
  
  return <>{children}</>;
};

export default RoleRoute;
```
