## Migration Guides

### Migrating from 1.x to 2.0

```jsx
// Old usage (1.x)
<Navigation
  navItems={items}

  searchPanelRef={searchPanelRef}
  toggleNavigation={handleToggleNav}
  toggleSearchPanel={handleToggleSearch}
  closeSearchPanel={handleCloseSearch}
  isSearching={isSearching}
  userRole="admin"
/>

// New usage (2.0)
<Navigation
  nav_items={items.map((item, index) => ({
    ...item,
    id: index + 1,
    level: item.requiredRole === 'admin' ? 10 : 0
  }))}
  sidenavRef={sidenavRef}
  searchPanelRef={searchPanelRef}
  toggleNav={handleToggleNav}
  toggleSearch={handleToggleSearch}
  closeSearch={handleCloseSearch}
  isSearching={isSearching}
/>
```

### Migrating from 1.4.x to 1.5.x

```jsx

  searchPanelRef={searchPanelRef}
  toggleNavigation={handleToggleNav}
  toggleSearchPanel={handleToggleSearch}
