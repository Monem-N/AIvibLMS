## Breaking Changes

### Version 2.0.0

The component was refactored to TypeScript in version 2.0.0, which introduced the following breaking changes:

1. **Stricter Type Checking**: Props are now strictly typed, so passing incorrect prop types will result in TypeScript errors
2. **React 16.8+ Required**: The component now uses React hooks, requiring React 16.8 or higher
3. **Redux State Structure**: The Redux state structure was updated to be more type-safe
4. **Context API Usage**: The component now uses the Context API for authentication and notifications

## Migration Guides

### Migrating from 1.x to 2.0

import DashboardModern from './components/dashboard/DashboardModern';

class DashboardPage extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <DashboardModern />;
  }
}

export default connect()(DashboardPage);

// After (TypeScript)
import React from 'react';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import { store } from './store';
import { AuthProvider } from './contexts/AuthContext';
import { NotificationProvider } from './contexts/NotificationContext';
import DashboardModern from './components/dashboard/DashboardModern';

const DashboardPage: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <AuthProvider>
        <NotificationProvider>
          <DashboardModern />
        </NotificationProvider>
