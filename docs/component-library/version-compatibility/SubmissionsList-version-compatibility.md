## Breaking Changes

### Version 2.0.0

The component was refactored to TypeScript in version 2.0.0, which introduced the following breaking changes:

1. **Stricter Type Checking**: Props are now strictly typed, so passing incorrect prop types will result in TypeScript errors
2. **React 16.8+ Required**: The component now uses React hooks, requiring React 16.8 or higher
3. **Submission Interface**: The component now requires a specific Submission interface for type checking
4. **React Router Required**: The component now requires React Router for navigation links

## Migration Guides

### Migrating from 1.x to 2.0

```jsx
// Before (JavaScript)
import React from 'react';
import SubmissionsList from 'components/grading/SubmissionsList';

const GradingPage = () => {
  const submissions = [
    {
      id: 'submission-1',
      activityId: 'activity-1',
      userId: 'user-1',
      submittedAt: '2023-04-15T14:30:00Z',
      status: 'submitted',
      // Other properties...
    }
  ];
  
  return (
    <div className="grading-container">
      <h1>Submissions to Grade</h1>
      <SubmissionsList 
        submissions={submissions}
        courseId="course-123"
      />
    </div>
  );
};

// After (TypeScript)
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';
import SubmissionsList from 'components/grading/SubmissionsList';
import { Submission } from '../../types/course';

const GradingPage: React.FC = () => {
  // Ensure submissions array conforms to Submission interface
  const submissions: Submission[] = [
    {
      id: 'submission-1',
      activityId: 'activity-1',
      userId: 'user-1',
      submittedAt: '2023-04-15T14:30:00Z',
      status: 'submitted',
      // Other properties...
    }
  ];
  
  return (
    <Router>
      <div className="grading-container">
        <h1>Submissions to Grade</h1>
        <SubmissionsList 
          submissions={submissions}
          courseId="course-123"
        />
      </div>
    </Router>
  );
};
```
