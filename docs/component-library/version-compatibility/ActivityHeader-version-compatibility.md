## Breaking Changes

### Version 2.0.0

The component was refactored to TypeScript in version 2.0.0, which introduced the following breaking changes:

1. **Stricter Type Checking**: Props are now strictly typed, so passing incorrect prop types will result in TypeScript errors
2. **React 16.8+ Required**: The component now uses React hooks, requiring React 16.8 or higher
3. **Activity Type Validation**: The component now validates activity types against a predefined set of values

## Migration Guides

### Migrating from 1.x to 2.0

```jsx
// Before (JavaScript)
<ActivityHeader 
  activity={{
    id: 'activity-123',
    title: 'Introduction to React',
    type: 'assignment',
    moduleId: 'module-123'
  }}
  courseId="course-123"
  moduleId="module-123"
/>

// After (TypeScript)
<ActivityHeader 
  activity={{
    id: 'activity-123',
    title: 'Introduction to React',
    type: 'assignment', // Must be one of: 'content', 'assignment', 'quiz', 'discussion'
    moduleId: 'module-123',
    order: 1 // Required in TypeScript version
  }}
  courseId="course-123"
  moduleId="module-123"
