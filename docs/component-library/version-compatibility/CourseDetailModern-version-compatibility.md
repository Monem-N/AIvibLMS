## Breaking Changes

### Version 2.0.0

The component was refactored to TypeScript in version 2.0.0, which introduced the following breaking changes:

1. **Stricter Type Checking**: Props are now strictly typed, so passing incorrect prop types will result in TypeScript errors
2. **React 16.8+ Required**: The component now uses React hooks, requiring React 16.8 or higher
3. **Redux State Structure**: The Redux state structure is now strictly typed, so any custom state selectors may need to be updated
4. **URL Parameter Handling**: The URL parameter handling is now strictly typed, so any custom URL parameter handling may need to be updated

## Migration Guides

### Migrating from 1.x to 2.0

```jsx
// Before (JavaScript)
// Accessing Redux state
const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  currentCourse: state.courses.currentCourse,
  loading: state.courses.loading,
  error: state.courses.error
});

// After (TypeScript)
// Accessing Redux state
import { RootState } from '../../types/state';

const mapStateToProps = (state: RootState) => ({
  currentCourse: state.courses.currentCourse,
  loading: state.courses.loading,
  error: state.courses.error
});

// OR using hooks
const { currentCourse, loading, error } = useSelector(
  (state: RootState) => state.courses
);
```
