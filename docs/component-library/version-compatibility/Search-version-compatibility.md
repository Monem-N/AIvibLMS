## Breaking Changes

### Version 2.0.0

The component was refactored to TypeScript in version 2.0.0, which introduced the following breaking changes:

1. **Stricter Type Checking**: Props are now strictly typed, so passing incorrect prop types will result in TypeScript errors
2. **React 16.8+ Required**: The component now uses React hooks, requiring React 16.8 or higher
3. **SearchProps Interface**: The component now requires a specific SearchProps interface for type checking
4. **React Router Required**: The component now requires React Router for navigation

## Migration Guides

### Migrating from 1.x to 2.0

```jsx
// Before (JavaScript)
import React from 'react';
import Search from 'components/search/Search';

const Navigation = () => {
  const searchPanelRef = React.useRef();
  const [isSearching, setIsSearching] = React.useState(false);
  
  const closeSearch = () => {
    setIsSearching(false);
  };
  
  return (
    <div className="navigation">
      <Search 
        searchPanelRef={searchPanelRef}
        closeSearch={closeSearch}
        isSearching={isSearching}
      />
    </div>
  );
};

// After (TypeScript)
import React, { useRef, useState } from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';
import Search from 'components/search/Search';

const Navigation: React.FC = () => {
  const searchPanelRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
  const [isSearching, setIsSearching] = useState<boolean>(false);
  
  const closeSearch = () => {
    setIsSearching(false);
  };
  
  return (
    <Router>
      <div className="navigation">
        <Search 
          searchPanelRef={searchPanelRef}
          closeSearch={closeSearch}
          isSearching={isSearching}
        />
      </div>
    </Router>
  );
};
```

4. Update your component usage to use the correct prop types
5. Wrap the component with a Router component if not already done
6. Test the component with your existing code to identify any type errors

### From 2.x to 3.x (Future)

2. Replace flyout class with component-specific styling
3. Update your component usage to match the new API
4. Test the component with your existing code to identify any issues
