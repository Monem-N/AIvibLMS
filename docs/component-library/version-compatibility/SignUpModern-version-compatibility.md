## Breaking Changes

### Version 2.0.0

The component was refactored to TypeScript in version 2.0.0, which introduced the following breaking changes:

1. **Stricter Type Checking**: Props are now strictly typed, so passing incorrect prop types will result in TypeScript errors
2. **React 16.8+ Required**: The component now uses React hooks, requiring React 16.8 or higher
3. **Callback Signatures**: The onSuccess and onCancel callbacks now have stricter type definitions
4. **UserInfo Interface**: The component now requires a UserInfo interface for user registration

## Migration Guides

### Migrating from 1.x to 2.0

```jsx
// Before (JavaScript)
<SignUpModern 
  onSuccess={function() { console.log('Success'); }}
  onCancel={function() { console.log('Cancelled'); }}
/>

// After (TypeScript)
<SignUpModern 
  onSuccess={() => { console.log('Success'); }}
  onCancel={() => { console.log('Cancelled'); }}
/>
```
