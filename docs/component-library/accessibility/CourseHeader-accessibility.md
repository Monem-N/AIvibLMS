## Recommendations for Improvement

1. Add more descriptive aria-labels to action buttons for better context
2. Implement skip links to bypass the header and go directly to course content
3. Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions (enroll, continue learning)
4. Improve focus management when toggling mobile view
5. Add more semantic structure with additional ARIA landmarks

## Testing Methodology

Testing was conducted using:
- Manual keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader testing with NVDA on Windows and VoiceOver on macOS
- Color contrast analysis using the WebAIM Contrast Checker
- Automated accessibility testing using axe-core

## Conclusion

The CourseHeader component meets all WCAG 2.1 AA standards and provides a good accessible experience. It uses proper semantic HTML, includes appropriate ARIA attributes, and provides clear visual and programmatic indication of course status and progress.

The component is fully keyboard accessible and works well with screen readers. All interactive elements have appropriate focus states and touch target sizes.

No significant accessibility issues were identified during testing. The recommendations provided are for further enhancement rather than fixing existing issues.
