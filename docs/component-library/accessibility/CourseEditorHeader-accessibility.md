## Header Accessibility

The CourseEditorHeader component implements a header pattern, which has the following accessibility considerations:

### Strengths

- Uses semantic HTML elements for proper structure
- Uses `<h1>` for the course title, providing proper document hierarchy
- Buttons have descriptive text that clearly indicates their purpose
- Disabled buttons have appropriate `disabled` and `aria-disabled` attributes
- Focus order follows a logical sequence

### Areas for Improvement

- Status badges could have better ARIA attributes to convey their meaning
- Cancel link could have more descriptive text for screen readers

## Keyboard Navigation

### Strengths

- All buttons and links are fully keyboard accessible
- Tab order follows a logical sequence from left to right
- Action buttons have appropriate keyboard event handlers
- Focus indicators are clearly visible

### Areas for Improvement

- None identified

## Screen Reader Considerations

### Strengths

- The component uses semantic HTML elements for proper screen reader interpretation
- The course title is in an `<h1>` element, providing proper document structure
- Buttons have descriptive text that clearly indicates their purpose

### Areas for Improvement

- Status badges could have better ARIA attributes to convey their meaning
- Cancel link could have more descriptive text for screen readers

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Add ARIA Attributes to Status Badges**:
   ```jsx
   // Before
   <span className="badge badge-success">Published</span>

   // After
   <span 
     className="badge badge-success"
     role="status"
     aria-label="Status: Published"
   >
     Published
   </span>
   ```

2. **Improve Cancel Link Description**:
   ```jsx
   // Before
   <Link 
     to="/courses" 
     className="btn btn-outline"
   >
     Cancel
   </Link>

   // After
   <Link 
     to="/courses" 
     className="btn btn-outline"
     aria-label="Cancel and return to courses"
   >
     Cancel
   </Link>
   ```

3. **Add ARIA Live Region for Saving State**:
   ```jsx
   // Before
   <button 
     className="btn btn-primary"
     onClick={onSave}
     disabled={saving}
   >
     {saving ? 'Saving...' : 'Save'}
   </button>

   // After
   <button 
     className="btn btn-primary"
     onClick={onSave}
     disabled={saving}
     aria-busy={saving}
   >
     <span aria-live="polite">
       {saving ? 'Saving...' : 'Save'}
     </span>
   </button>
   ```

## Testing Methodology

Testing for the CourseEditorHeader component should focus on the following areas:

1. **Screen Reader Testing**:
   - Test with popular screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
   - Verify that the course title is properly announced
   - Check that status badges are properly announced
   - Ensure that buttons and their states are properly announced
   - Verify that the saving state is properly announced

2. **Keyboard Navigation Testing**:
   - Test that all buttons and links can be accessed using the Tab key
   - Verify that the tab order follows a logical sequence
   - Check that buttons can be activated using the Enter key
   - Ensure that disabled buttons are properly skipped in the tab order

3. **Color Contrast Testing**:
   - Use tools like the WebAIM Color Contrast Checker to verify contrast ratios
   - Test with color vision deficiency simulators
   - Ensure that all text and interactive elements have sufficient contrast

4. **Cognitive Testing**:
   - Test with users who have cognitive disabilities
   - Verify that the header is easy to understand and use
   - Check that button labels are clear and descriptive
   - Ensure that the header is not overwhelming or confusing

## Conclusion

The CourseEditorHeader component is generally accessible but has a few areas for improvement, particularly around ARIA attributes for status badges and more descriptive text for screen readers. By implementing the recommendations in this report, the component can be made more accessible to users with disabilities, providing a better user experience for all users.

The most critical improvements are:
1. Adding ARIA attributes to status badges
2. Improving the cancel link description
3. Adding ARIA live region for saving state

These improvements would address the most significant accessibility issues with the component while maintaining its core functionality.
