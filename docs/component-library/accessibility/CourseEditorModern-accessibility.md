## Container Component Accessibility

The CourseEditorModern component is primarily a container component that delegates most of its UI rendering to child components. As such, its accessibility considerations focus on the overall structure and flow rather than specific UI elements:

### Strengths

- Uses semantic HTML elements for proper structure
- Provides clear error messages for validation failures
- Shows loading indicators during data fetching
- Maintains focus within the editor when switching tabs
- Uses child components that implement their own accessibility features

### Areas for Improvement

- Tab interface could use better ARIA attributes for accessibility
- Error messages could be better announced to screen readers
- Focus management could be improved when switching between tabs
- Keyboard navigation between tabs could be more intuitive
- Missing proper error boundaries for graceful error handling

## Keyboard Navigation

### Strengths

- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Tab order follows a logical sequence from header to tabs to content
- Action buttons have appropriate keyboard event handlers

### Areas for Improvement

- Tab navigation between tabs could be improved with arrow key support
- Focus management when switching tabs could be improved
- Focus trapping within modal dialogs (if used) could be implemented

## Screen Reader Considerations

### Strengths

- Uses semantic HTML elements for proper screen reader interpretation
- Loading and error states are properly announced to screen readers
- Form validation errors are announced to screen readers

### Areas for Improvement

- Tab changes could be better announced to screen readers
- Error messages could be better associated with their respective form fields
- Success messages could be better announced to screen readers
- ARIA live regions could be used for dynamic content updates

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Improve Tab Interface Accessibility**:
   ```jsx
   // Before
   <div className="course-editor-tabs">
     <div className="tabs-container">
       {tabs.map(tab => (
         <button
           key={tab.id}
           className={`tab-item ${activeTab === tab.id ? 'active' : ''}`}
           onClick={() => onTabChange(tab.id)}
         >
           <span className="tab-icon">{tab.icon}</span>
           <span className="tab-label">{tab.label}</span>
         </button>
       ))}
     </div>
   </div>

   // After
   <div className="course-editor-tabs" role="tablist" aria-label="Course Editor Sections">
     <div className="tabs-container">
       {tabs.map(tab => (
         <button
           key={tab.id}
           id={`tab-${tab.id}`}
           className={`tab-item ${activeTab === tab.id ? 'active' : ''}`}
           onClick={() => onTabChange(tab.id)}
           onKeyDown={handleTabKeyDown}
           role="tab"
           aria-selected={activeTab === tab.id}
           aria-controls={`panel-${tab.id}`}
           tabIndex={activeTab === tab.id ? 0 : -1}
         >
           <span className="tab-icon" aria-hidden="true">{tab.icon}</span>
           <span className="tab-label">{tab.label}</span>
         </button>
       ))}
     </div>
   </div>

   // Tab content
   <div 
     id={`panel-${activeTab}`}
     role="tabpanel"
     aria-labelledby={`tab-${activeTab}`}
     tabIndex={0}
   >
     {/* Tab content */}
   </div>
   ```

2. **Improve Error Message Accessibility**:
   ```jsx
   // Before
   const handleSave = async () => {
     if (!courseData.title) {
       showError('Course title is required');
       return;
     }
     // Rest of function
   };

   // After
   const handleSave = async () => {
     if (!courseData.title) {
       showError('Course title is required', {
         ariaLive: 'assertive',
         associatedElement: 'title-input'
       });
       document.getElementById('title-input').focus();
       return;
     }
     // Rest of function
   };
   ```

3. **Add ARIA Live Regions for Dynamic Content**:
   ```jsx
   // Before
   return (
     <div className="course-editor-container">
       {/* Component content */}
     </div>
   );

   // After
   return (
     <div className="course-editor-container">
       <div aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true" className="sr-only">
         {loading ? 'Loading course data' : ''}
         {error ? `Error: ${error}` : ''}
         {saving ? 'Saving course' : ''}
       </div>
       {/* Component content */}
     </div>
   );
   ```

4. **Improve Focus Management When Switching Tabs**:
   ```jsx
   // Before
   const handleTabChange = (tab: string) => {
     setActiveTab(tab);
   };

   // After
   const handleTabChange = (tab: string) => {
     setActiveTab(tab);
     
     // Set timeout to allow for render
     setTimeout(() => {
       const tabPanel = document.getElementById(`panel-${tab}`);
       if (tabPanel) {
         tabPanel.focus();
       }
     }, 10);
   };
   ```

5. **Add Keyboard Navigation for Tabs**:
   ```jsx
   const handleTabKeyDown = (e: React.KeyboardEvent, tabIndex: number) => {
     const tabsCount = tabs.length;
     
     switch (e.key) {
       case 'ArrowRight':
         e.preventDefault();
         const nextTab = (tabIndex + 1) % tabsCount;
         document.getElementById(`tab-${tabs[nextTab].id}`)?.focus();
         break;
       case 'ArrowLeft':
         e.preventDefault();
         const prevTab = (tabIndex - 1 + tabsCount) % tabsCount;
         document.getElementById(`tab-${tabs[prevTab].id}`)?.focus();
         break;
       case 'Home':
         e.preventDefault();
         document.getElementById(`tab-${tabs[0].id}`)?.focus();
         break;
       case 'End':
         e.preventDefault();
         document.getElementById(`tab-${tabs[tabsCount - 1].id}`)?.focus();
         break;
     }
   };
   ```

## Testing Methodology

Testing for the CourseEditorModern component should focus on the following areas:

1. **Screen Reader Testing**:
   - Test with popular screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
   - Verify that tab changes are properly announced
   - Check that error messages are properly announced
   - Ensure that loading and saving states are properly announced
   - Verify that form fields and their labels are properly associated

2. **Keyboard Navigation Testing**:
   - Test that all interactive elements can be accessed using the Tab key
   - Verify that the tab order follows a logical sequence
   - Check that tabs can be navigated using arrow keys
   - Ensure that focus is properly managed when switching tabs
   - Test that error messages can be accessed using keyboard navigation

3. **Color Contrast Testing**:
   - Use tools like the WebAIM Color Contrast Checker to verify contrast ratios
   - Test with color vision deficiency simulators
   - Ensure that all text and interactive elements have sufficient contrast

4. **Cognitive Testing**:
   - Test with users who have cognitive disabilities
   - Verify that the interface is easy to understand and use
   - Check that error messages are clear and helpful
   - Ensure that the tab-based interface is intuitive and easy to navigate

## Conclusion

The CourseEditorModern component is generally accessible but has several areas for improvement, particularly around tab interface accessibility, error message accessibility, and focus management. By implementing the recommendations in this report, the component can be made more accessible to users with disabilities, providing a better user experience for all users.

The most critical improvements are:
1. Improving the tab interface with proper ARIA attributes
2. Enhancing error message accessibility with ARIA live regions
3. Implementing better focus management when switching tabs
4. Adding keyboard navigation for tabs using arrow keys

These improvements would address the most significant accessibility issues with the component while maintaining its core functionality.
