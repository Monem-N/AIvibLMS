## Identified Issues and Remediation

| Issue | WCAG Criterion | Severity | Remediation Plan | Status |
|-------|----------------|----------|------------------|--------|
| None identified | - | - | - | - |

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. Add support for aria-errormessage attribute for better screen reader announcement of errors
2. Implement more robust form validation with clear error messages
3. Add support for input masks for formatted inputs (phone numbers, credit cards, etc.)
4. Improve contrast ratio of helper text to meet AAA standards

## Testing Methodology

Testing was conducted using:
- Manual keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader testing with NVDA on Windows and VoiceOver on macOS
- Color contrast analysis using the WebAIM Contrast Checker
- Automated accessibility testing using axe-core

## Conclusion

The Input component meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards and provides a good accessible experience. It uses proper semantic HTML, includes appropriate ARIA attributes, and provides clear visual and programmatic indication of states such as focus, error, and disabled. The component is fully keyboard accessible and works well with screen readers.

Some minor improvements could be made to enhance the accessibility further, particularly around error handling and contrast ratios, but these are not critical issues and do not prevent users with disabilities from using the component effectively.
