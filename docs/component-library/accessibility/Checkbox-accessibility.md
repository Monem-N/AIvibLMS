## Identified Issues and Remediation

|-------|----------------|----------|------------------|--------|
| None identified | - | - | - | - |

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. Add support for custom checkmark icons for better visual customization
2. Improve contrast ratio of helper text to meet AAA standards
3. Add support for checkbox groups with fieldset and legend for better screen reader context
4. Implement a more robust focus visible state for keyboard-only users

## Testing Methodology

Testing was conducted using:
- Manual keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader testing with NVDA on Windows and VoiceOver on macOS
- Color contrast analysis using the WebAIM Contrast Checker
- Automated accessibility testing using axe-core

## Conclusion

The Checkbox component meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards and provides a good accessible experience. It uses proper semantic HTML, includes appropriate ARIA attributes, and provides clear visual and programmatic indication of states such as focus, checked, indeterminate, error, and disabled. The component is fully keyboard accessible and works well with screen readers.

Some minor improvements could be made to enhance the accessibility further, particularly around contrast ratios and checkbox grouping, but these are not critical issues and do not prevent users with disabilities from using the component effectively.
