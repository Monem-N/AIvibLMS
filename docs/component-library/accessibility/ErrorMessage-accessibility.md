## Keyboard Navigation

| Action | Keys | Implemented | Notes |
|--------|------|-------------|-------|
| Focus retry button | Tab | ✅ Yes | |
| Activate retry button | Enter/Space | ✅ Yes | |

## Screen Reader Testing

| Screen Reader | Browser | Result | Notes |
|---------------|---------|--------|-------|
| NVDA | Chrome | ⚠️ Partial | Error message is announced but not as an alert |
| NVDA | Firefox | ⚠️ Partial | Error message is announced but not as an alert |
| VoiceOver | Safari | ⚠️ Partial | Error message is announced but not as an alert |
| JAWS | Chrome | ⚠️ Partial | Error message is announced but not as an alert |

## ARIA Implementation

| ARIA Attribute | Used | Purpose | Notes |
|----------------|------|---------|-------|
| role="alert" | ❌ No | Indicate an important and time-sensitive message | Should be added to the container |
| aria-live="assertive" | ❌ No | Announce the error immediately | Should be added to the container |

## Color and Contrast

| Element | Contrast Ratio | Passes AA | Passes AAA | Notes |
|---------|----------------|-----------|------------|-------|
| Error icon | 4.5:1 | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Red icon on white background |
| Error title | 4.5:1 | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Red text on white background |
| Error message | 7:1 | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Dark gray text on white background |

| Retry button | 48px height | ✅ Yes | Meets minimum touch target size |

## Identified Issues and Remediation

| Issue | WCAG Criterion | Severity | Remediation Plan | Status |
|-------|----------------|----------|------------------|--------|
| Missing ARIA attributes | 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value | High | Add role="alert" and aria-live="assertive" to the container | Planned for v2.1.0 |
| No network detection | 3.3.3 Error Suggestion | Medium | Add network connectivity detection and disable retry button when offline | Planned for v2.2.0 |

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. Add `role="alert"` to the container element
2. Add `aria-live="assertive"` to announce error state changes
3. Add network connectivity detection to disable the retry button when offline
4. Consider adding more specific error messages based on the type of error
5. Add a visually hidden text that explicitly states "Error:" for screen readers

## Testing Methodology

Testing was conducted using:
- Manual keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader testing with NVDA on Windows and VoiceOver on macOS
- Color contrast analysis using the WebAIM Contrast Checker
- Automated accessibility testing using axe-core

## Conclusion

The ErrorMessage component partially meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards. While it provides good visual feedback for error states and is keyboard accessible, it has some accessibility issues that should be addressed in future releases:

1. The component lacks proper ARIA attributes for screen readers, which makes it difficult for screen reader users to understand that an error has occurred.
2. The component doesn't detect network connectivity, which may cause confusion when the retry button is pressed while offline.

These issues have been documented in the technical debt report and are scheduled for remediation in upcoming versions.
