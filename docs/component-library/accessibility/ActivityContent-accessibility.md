5. Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions in discussion forum

## Testing Methodology

Testing was conducted using:
- Manual keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader testing with NVDA on Windows and VoiceOver on macOS
- Color contrast analysis using the WebAIM Contrast Checker
- Automated accessibility testing using axe-core

## Conclusion

The ActivityContent component meets all WCAG 2.1 AA standards and provides a good accessible experience. It uses proper semantic HTML, includes appropriate ARIA attributes, and provides clear visual and programmatic indication of states.

The component is fully keyboard accessible and works well with screen readers. All interactive elements have appropriate focus states and most touch target sizes meet requirements.

Two minor accessibility issues were identified during testing and have been scheduled for remediation in upcoming releases. The recommendations provided will further enhance the component's accessibility.
