# Accessibility Compliance Report: ForgotPasswordModern Component

## Overview

This report assesses the accessibility compliance of the `ForgotPasswordModern` component based on general web accessibility guidelines (e.g., WCAG 2.1).

## Compliance Assessment

### 1. Keyboard Navigation

-   **Status**: Compliant
-   **Details**: Interactive elements (email input, buttons, links) are standard HTML elements and are naturally included in the tab order.

### 2. Screen Reader Support

-   **Status**: Compliant
-   **Details**: Semantic HTML5 elements are used (`<form>`, `<label>`, `<input>`, `<button>`, `<p>`, `<h2>`, `<a>`). The email input has a clearly associated `<label>` using the `htmlFor` attribute. The form has a `role="form"` attribute for better ARIA support.

### 3. ARIA Attributes

-   **Status**: Compliant
-   **Details**: A `role="form"` attribute is used on the form element. No other complex ARIA attributes are currently necessary based on the component's functionality.

### 4. Color Contrast

-   **Status**: Requires Verification
-   **Details**: The component uses CSS classes defined in `ForgotPassword.css`. The color contrast of text against background colors (especially for text, buttons, and links) needs to be verified against WCAG 2.1 AA or AAA standards using a color contrast checker.

### 5. Focus Management

-   **Status**: Compliant
-   **Details**: Focus is managed by the browser's default behavior for form elements and links. When the success message is displayed, the focus remains on the container, which is acceptable for this simple state change.

## Recommendations

-   Verify color contrast ratios of all text and interactive elements using a color contrast checker to ensure compliance with WCAG 2.1 standards.
