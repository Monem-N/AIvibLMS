|-------|----------------|----------|------------------|--------|
| Tab changes not announced | 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value | High | Add aria-live region for tab changes | Planned for v2.4.0 |

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. Add proper ARIA attributes to the tab interface:
   ```jsx
   <div role="tablist">
     <button 
       role="tab" 
       id="tab-modules" 
       aria-selected={activeTab === 'modules'} 
       aria-controls="panel-modules"
     >
       Modules
     </button>
     {/* Other tabs */}
   </div>
   
   <div 
     role="tabpanel" 
     id="panel-modules" 
     aria-labelledby="tab-modules"
     hidden={activeTab !== 'modules'}
   >
     {/* Modules content */}
   </div>
   ```

2. Add an aria-live region to announce tab changes:
   ```jsx
   <div aria-live="polite" className="sr-only">
     {activeTab === 'modules' && 'Modules tab selected'}
     {activeTab === 'resources' && 'Resources tab selected'}
     {/* Other tabs */}
   </div>
   ```

3. Improve focus management when switching tabs:
   ```jsx
   const handleTabChange = (tab: string) => {
     setActiveTab(tab);
     
     // Focus the tab panel after tab change
     setTimeout(() => {
       const panel = document.getElementById(`panel-${tab}`);
       if (panel) {
         panel.focus();
       }
     }, 0);
   };
   ```

4. Enhance focus indicators:
   ```css
   [role="tab"]:focus {
     outline: 2px solid #4a90e2;
     outline-offset: 2px;
   }
   ```

5. Add keyboard navigation between tabs:
   ```jsx
   const handleTabKeyDown = (e: React.KeyboardEvent, tabs: string[]) => {
     const currentIndex = tabs.indexOf(activeTab);
     
     if (e.key === 'ArrowRight' || e.key === 'ArrowDown') {
       const nextIndex = (currentIndex + 1) % tabs.length;
       handleTabChange(tabs[nextIndex]);
       e.preventDefault();
     } else if (e.key === 'ArrowLeft' || e.key === 'ArrowUp') {
       const prevIndex = (currentIndex - 1 + tabs.length) % tabs.length;
       handleTabChange(tabs[prevIndex]);
       e.preventDefault();
     }
   };
   ```

## Testing Methodology

Testing was conducted using:
- Manual keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader testing with NVDA on Windows and VoiceOver on macOS
- Color contrast analysis using the WebAIM Contrast Checker
- Automated accessibility testing using axe-core

## Conclusion

The CourseDetailModern component partially meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards. It provides good semantic structure and color contrast, but has some accessibility issues that should be addressed in future releases:

1. Tab changes are not properly announced to screen readers, making it difficult for screen reader users to know when the active tab has changed.
2. The tab interface is missing proper ARIA attributes, which reduces its accessibility to screen reader users.
3. Focus management when switching tabs needs improvement to ensure keyboard users can navigate efficiently.
4. Focus indicators could be enhanced to be more visible for keyboard users.

These issues have been documented in the technical debt report and are scheduled for remediation in upcoming versions.
