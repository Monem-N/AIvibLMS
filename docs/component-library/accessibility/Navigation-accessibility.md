## Identified Issues and Remediation

| Issue | WCAG Criterion | Severity | Remediation Plan | Status |
|-------|----------------|----------|------------------|--------|
| Limited keyboard navigation between menu items | 2.1.1 Keyboard | Medium | Implement arrow key navigation within menu levels | Planned for v2.3.0 |
| Focus management in mobile view | 2.4.3 Focus Order | Low | Improve focus trapping in mobile menu | Planned for v2.3.0 |

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. Implement arrow key navigation within menu levels for better keyboard accessibility
2. Add role="menubar" and role="menu" to appropriate elements for better screen reader context
3. Improve focus management when opening/closing the mobile navigation menu
4. Add skip links to bypass navigation and go directly to main content
5. Enhance the current page indicator for better visibility (both visually and programmatically)

## Testing Methodology

Testing was conducted using:
- Manual keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader testing with NVDA on Windows and VoiceOver on macOS
- Color contrast analysis using the WebAIM Contrast Checker
- Automated accessibility testing using axe-core

## Conclusion

The Navigation component meets most WCAG 2.1 AA standards and provides a good accessible experience. It uses proper semantic HTML, includes appropriate ARIA attributes, and provides clear visual and programmatic indication of states such as expanded/collapsed and current page.

The main area for improvement is keyboard navigation between menu items, which currently relies on Tab navigation rather than arrow keys. This is planned for implementation in version 2.3.0. Overall, the component is accessible to users with disabilities, with only minor improvements needed to achieve full compliance.
