## ARIA Implementation

| ARIA Attribute | Used | Purpose | Notes |
|----------------|------|---------|-------|
| aria-label="Breadcrumb" | ❌ No | Identify the navigation as breadcrumbs | Should be added to the container |
| aria-current="page" | ❌ No | Indicate the current page | Should be added to the current breadcrumb |
| aria-hidden="true" | ❌ No | Hide separator from screen readers | Should be added to separators |

## Color and Contrast

| Element | Contrast Ratio | Passes AA | Passes AAA | Notes |
|---------|----------------|-----------|------------|-------|
| Breadcrumb links | 4.5:1 | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Blue links on light background |
| Current page text | 7:1 | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Dark gray text on light background |

## Identified Issues and Remediation

| Issue | WCAG Criterion | Severity | Remediation Plan | Status |
|-------|----------------|----------|------------------|--------|
| Missing ARIA attributes | 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value | High | Add aria-label="Breadcrumb" to container and aria-current="page" to current page | Planned for v2.1.0 |
| Separator character | 1.3.1 Info and Relationships | Medium | Use a more semantic separator with aria-hidden="true" | Planned for v2.1.0 |

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. Add `aria-label="Breadcrumb"` to the container element
2. Add `aria-current="page"` to the current page breadcrumb
3. Add `aria-hidden="true"` to the separator characters
4. Consider using a more semantic separator (e.g., "›" instead of "/")
5. Ensure all breadcrumb links have adequate touch target size
6. Add schema.org microdata for better SEO

## Testing Methodology

Testing was conducted using:
- Manual keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader testing with NVDA on Windows and VoiceOver on macOS
- Color contrast analysis using the WebAIM Contrast Checker
- Automated accessibility testing using axe-core

## Conclusion

The Breadcrumbs component partially meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards. While it provides good keyboard accessibility and uses semantic HTML, it has some accessibility issues that should be addressed in future releases:

1. The component lacks proper ARIA attributes for screen readers, which makes it difficult for screen reader users to understand the navigation structure.
2. The separator character is not hidden from screen readers, which may cause confusion.

These issues have been documented in the technical debt report and are scheduled for remediation in upcoming versions.
