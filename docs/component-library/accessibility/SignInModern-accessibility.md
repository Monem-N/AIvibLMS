## Identified Issues and Remediation

| Issue | WCAG Criterion | Severity | Remediation Plan | Status |
|-------|----------------|----------|------------------|--------|
| Error messages not associated with inputs | 3.3.1 Error Identification | High | Add aria-describedby to inputs and IDs to error messages | Planned for v2.3.0 |
| Validation errors not announced to screen readers | 4.1.3 Status Messages | Medium | Add aria-live="polite" to error message container | Planned for v2.3.0 |
| Link touch targets may be too small | 2.5.5 Target Size | Low | Increase touch target size for links | Planned for v2.4.0 |

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. Add `aria-describedby` to inputs and IDs to error messages to associate them
2. Add `aria-live="polite"` to error message container to announce validation errors
3. Increase touch target size for links to meet the 44x44px recommendation
4. Consider using a form library like Formik or React Hook Form for better accessibility
5. Add more descriptive error messages for different validation scenarios
6. Add `aria-invalid="true"` to inputs with validation errors
7. Consider adding a visible focus indicator for keyboard navigation

## Testing Methodology

Testing was conducted using:
- Manual keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader testing with NVDA on Windows and VoiceOver on macOS
- Color contrast analysis using the WebAIM Contrast Checker
- Automated accessibility testing using axe-core

## Conclusion

The SignInModern component partially meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards. It provides good keyboard accessibility and uses semantic HTML, but has some accessibility issues that should be addressed in future releases:

1. Error messages are not directly associated with form inputs, making it difficult for screen reader users to understand which field has an error.
2. Validation errors are not announced to screen readers, so users may not be aware of validation issues.
3. Some touch targets may be too small for users with motor impairments.

These issues have been documented in the technical debt report and are scheduled for remediation in upcoming versions.
