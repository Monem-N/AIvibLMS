## Screen Reader Testing

| Screen Reader | Browser | Result | Notes |
|---------------|---------|--------|-------|
| NVDA | Chrome | ⚠️ Partial | Message is announced but loading state is not clearly indicated |
| NVDA | Firefox | ⚠️ Partial | Message is announced but loading state is not clearly indicated |
| VoiceOver | Safari | ⚠️ Partial | Message is announced but loading state is not clearly indicated |
| JAWS | Chrome | ⚠️ Partial | Message is announced but loading state is not clearly indicated |

## ARIA Implementation

| ARIA Attribute | Used | Purpose | Notes |
|----------------|------|---------|-------|
| role="status" | ❌ No | Indicate a status message | Should be added to the container |
| aria-live="polite" | ❌ No | Announce changes to the loading state | Should be added to the container |

## Color and Contrast

| Element | Contrast Ratio | Passes AA | Passes AAA | Notes |
|---------|----------------|-----------|------------|-------|
| Spinner border | 4.5:1 | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Blue spinner border on white background |
| Loading message | 4.5:1 | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Dark gray text on white background |

## Motion and Animation

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Respects reduced motion preferences | ❌ No | Does not detect prefers-reduced-motion |
| No auto-playing animations | ⚠️ Partial | Animation plays automatically but is essential for functionality |
| Animations can be paused | ❌ No | Animation cannot be paused |
| No content flashing more than 3 times per second | ✅ Yes | Spinner rotates smoothly without flashing |

## Identified Issues and Remediation

| Issue | WCAG Criterion | Severity | Remediation Plan | Status |
|-------|----------------|----------|------------------|--------|
| Missing ARIA attributes | 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value | High | Add role="status" and aria-live="polite" to the container | Planned for v2.1.0 |
| No reduced motion support | 2.3.3 Animation from Interactions | Medium | Add media query for prefers-reduced-motion | Planned for v2.1.0 |

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. Add `role="status"` to the container element
2. Add `aria-live="polite"` to announce loading state changes
3. Implement support for prefers-reduced-motion media query
4. Consider adding an alternative non-animated loading indicator for reduced motion
5. Add a visually hidden text that explicitly states "Loading" for screen readers

## Testing Methodology

Testing was conducted using:
- Manual screen reader testing with NVDA on Windows and VoiceOver on macOS
- Color contrast analysis using the WebAIM Contrast Checker
- Automated accessibility testing using axe-core

## Conclusion

The LoadingSpinner component partially meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards. While it provides good visual feedback for loading states, it has some accessibility issues that should be addressed in future releases:

1. The component lacks proper ARIA attributes for screen readers, which makes it difficult for screen reader users to understand that content is loading.
2. The animation doesn't respect the user's reduced motion preferences, which may cause issues for users with vestibular disorders.

These issues have been documented in the technical debt report and are scheduled for remediation in version 2.1.0.
