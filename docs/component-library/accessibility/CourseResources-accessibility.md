## Resource Organization Accessibility

The CourseResources component organizes resources by type, which has the following accessibility considerations:

### Strengths

- Resources are grouped by type, making it easier for users to find specific types of content
- Each group has a clear heading (h3) that identifies the resource type
- The heading hierarchy is properly structured (h2 for component title, h3 for resource groups, h4 for resource names)
- The grouping provides a clear mental model for users with cognitive disabilities

### Areas for Improvement

- Consider adding a "skip to search" link for keyboard users to bypass the resource groups
- Add keyboard shortcuts to navigate between resource groups
- Consider adding a count of resources in each group to the group heading

## Search Functionality Accessibility

The search functionality allows users to filter resources by name:

### Strengths

- The search input is clearly labeled and has a visible search icon
- The search filters in real-time as the user types
- When no results are found, a clear message is displayed with a button to clear the search
- The search input is properly focused when the clear search button is clicked

### Areas for Improvement

- Add keyboard shortcuts for search (e.g., Ctrl+F or Command+F)
- Add an explicit label element for the search input instead of just aria-label
- Add a clear button within the search input for easier clearing
- Announce search results to screen readers using an ARIA live region

## Resource Links Accessibility

The resource links allow users to download or access resources:

### Strengths

- Each resource link has a descriptive name and metadata
- Links open in a new tab with appropriate rel="noopener noreferrer" attributes
- Each link has an appropriate aria-label that includes the resource name, type, and size
- The download icon provides a visual cue for the action

### Areas for Improvement

- Add more descriptive ARIA labels that include the action (e.g., "Download [resource name]")
- Consider adding a tooltip or description for the download action
- Ensure that the target="_blank" behavior is announced to screen readers
- Add a visual and auditory indication when a download starts

## Keyboard Navigation

### Strengths

- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Focus order follows a logical sequence
- Focus indicators are clearly visible
- The search input and resource links can be navigated using the Tab key

### Areas for Improvement

- Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions (search, clear search)
- Improve focus management when clearing search results
- Add arrow key navigation between resource groups
- Consider adding a keyboard shortcut to download the currently focused resource

## Screen Reader Considerations

### Strengths

- The component uses semantic HTML elements
- Resource groups use proper heading hierarchy
- Resource names are properly marked up as headings
- SVG icons include appropriate ARIA attributes

### Areas for Improvement

- Add ARIA live regions for dynamic content (search results)
- Improve ARIA labels for resource links
- Ensure that resource metadata is properly announced
- Add more descriptive announcements for empty states

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Add Keyboard Shortcuts**:
   ```jsx
   useEffect(() => {
     const handleKeyDown = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
       // Focus search input on Ctrl+F or Command+F
       if ((e.ctrlKey || e.metaKey) && e.key === 'f') {
         e.preventDefault();
         searchInputRef.current?.focus();
       }
       
       // Clear search on Escape when search input is focused
       if (e.key === 'Escape' && document.activeElement === searchInputRef.current) {
         e.preventDefault();
         setSearchQuery('');
       }
     };
     
     document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
     return () => document.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
   }, [setSearchQuery]);
   ```

2. **Improve ARIA Labels for Resource Links**:
   ```jsx
   <a 
     key={resource.id}
     href={resource.url}
     target="_blank"
     rel="noopener noreferrer"
     className="resource-item"
     aria-label={`Download ${resource.name}, ${type} file, ${formatFileSize(resource.size)}, opens in new tab`}
   >
     {/* Resource content */}
   </a>
   ```

3. **Add ARIA Live Region for Search Results**:
   ```jsx
   <div 
     className="resources-content" 
     aria-live="polite"
     aria-atomic="true"
   >
     {filteredResources.length === 0 ? (
       <div className="resources-empty">
         <h3>No Resources Found</h3>
         <p>No resources match your search query.</p>
         <button 
           className="btn btn-primary"
           onClick={() => setSearchQuery('')}
         >
           Clear Search
         </button>
       </div>
     ) : (
       /* Resource groups */
     )}
   </div>
   ```

4. **Add Skip Link for Keyboard Users**:
   ```jsx
   <div className="course-resources">
     <a href="#resources-search" className="skip-link">
       Skip to search
     </a>
     
     <div className="resources-header">
       <h2 className="resources-title">Course Resources</h2>
       <div id="resources-search" className="resources-search">
         {/* Search input */}
       </div>
     </div>
     
     {/* Component content */}
   </div>
   ```

5. **Add Resource Counts to Group Headings**:
   ```jsx
   <div key={type} className="resource-group">
     <h3 className="resource-group-title">
       {type} <span className="resource-count">({resources.length})</span>
     </h3>
     {/* Resource list */}
   </div>
   ```

## Testing Methodology

Testing for the CourseResources component should focus on the following areas:

1. **Screen Reader Testing**:
   - Test with popular screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
   - Verify that resource groups and headings are properly announced
   - Check that resource links are properly announced with all relevant information
   - Ensure that search results and empty states are properly announced

2. **Keyboard Navigation Testing**:
   - Test that all interactive elements can be accessed using the keyboard
   - Verify that focus order is logical
   - Check that focus is properly managed when clearing search results
   - Test keyboard shortcuts (once implemented)

3. **Color Contrast Testing**:
   - Use tools like the WebAIM Color Contrast Checker to verify contrast ratios
   - Test with color vision deficiency simulators
   - Ensure that all text and interactive elements have sufficient contrast

4. **Cognitive Testing**:
   - Test with users who have cognitive disabilities
   - Verify that the resource organization is clear and understandable
   - Check that search functionality is intuitive and easy to use

## Conclusion

The CourseResources component is generally accessible but has some areas for improvement, particularly around keyboard shortcuts, ARIA labels, and dynamic content announcements. By implementing the recommendations in this report, the component can be made more accessible to users with disabilities, providing a better user experience for all users.

The most critical improvements are:
1. Adding keyboard shortcuts for search and navigation
2. Improving ARIA labels for resource links
3. Adding ARIA live regions for dynamic content

These improvements would address the most significant accessibility issues with the component while maintaining its core functionality.
