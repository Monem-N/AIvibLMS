3. Increase touch target size for breadcrumb links on mobile
4. Add more descriptive text alternatives for informative icons
5. Implement an icon component system with built-in accessibility features
6. Add more descriptive ARIA labels to interactive elements

## Testing Methodology

Testing was conducted using:
- Manual keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader testing with NVDA on Windows and VoiceOver on macOS
- Color contrast analysis using the WebAIM Contrast Checker
- Automated accessibility testing using axe-core

## Conclusion

The ActivityHeader component partially meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards. It provides good keyboard accessibility and uses semantic HTML, but has some accessibility issues that should be addressed in future releases:

1. SVG icons need proper text alternatives
2. Some status badges may not meet contrast requirements
3. Breadcrumb links may be too small on mobile

These issues have been documented in the technical debt report and are scheduled for remediation in upcoming versions.
