# GradingHeader Component - Accessibility Compliance Report

## Overview

This document assesses the accessibility compliance of the `GradingHeader` component used in the Hypatia LMS grading dashboard. The evaluation is based on WCAG 2.1 guidelines and best practices for creating accessible web interfaces.

## Compliance Summary

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Semantic HTML | ✅ Compliant | Uses appropriate heading levels and semantic elements |
| Keyboard Navigation | ✅ Compliant | All interactive elements are keyboard accessible |
| Color Contrast | ✅ Compliant | Text meets WCAG AA contrast requirements |
| Screen Reader Support | ✅ Compliant | Uses proper text alternatives for non-text content |
| Focus Management | ✅ Compliant | Focus states are visually indicated |
| Text Resizing | ✅ Compliant | Component handles text resizing without loss of functionality |

## Detailed Assessment

### Semantic HTML Structure

- **Heading Hierarchy**: Uses `<h1>` for the main heading "Grading Dashboard", maintaining proper document outline
- **Navigation**: Uses appropriate link elements for navigation
- **Content Structure**: Logical grouping of related elements

### Keyboard Accessibility

- **Tab Order**: Natural and logical tab sequence
- **Focus Indicators**: Visible focus states on all interactive elements
- **Keyboard Operability**: All functions can be performed using keyboard alone

### Color and Contrast

- **Text Contrast**: Main text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against background
- **UI Elements**: Interactive elements have sufficient contrast
- **Information Conveyance**: Color is not the sole means of conveying information

### Screen Reader Compatibility

- **Text Alternatives**: SVG icon in the back button has appropriate text label ("Back to Course")
- **Meaningful Sequence**: Content is presented in a meaningful order
- **Status Information**: Submission count is associated with its label

## Areas for Improvement

### ARIA Enhancements

- **Recommendation**: Add `aria-live="polite"` to the submission count badge to announce changes
- **Impact**: Improves experience for screen reader users when submission count updates
- **Implementation Complexity**: Low

### Internationalization

- **Recommendation**: Implement proper internationalization for text strings
- **Impact**: Ensures accessibility for non-English speaking users
- **Implementation Complexity**: Medium

### Enhanced Focus Management

- **Recommendation**: Implement skip navigation for keyboard users
- **Impact**: Improves efficiency for keyboard users navigating through the application
- **Implementation Complexity**: Medium

## Testing Methodology

### Automated Testing

- **Tools Used**: Axe DevTools, Lighthouse
- **Coverage**: Basic accessibility violations and best practices
- **Results**: No critical issues detected

### Manual Testing

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Verified all functionality is accessible via keyboard
- **Screen Reader Testing**: Tested with VoiceOver on macOS
- **Zoom Testing**: Verified component behavior at 200% zoom

## Compliance Standards

### WCAG 2.1 Conformance

| Guideline | Level | Status | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------|
| 1.1.1 Non-text Content | A | ✅ Pass | SVG icon has text alternative |
| 1.3.1 Info and Relationships | A | ✅ Pass | Semantic structure conveys relationships |

## Conclusion

The `GradingHeader` component demonstrates strong accessibility compliance across major categories. It uses semantic HTML, provides keyboard accessibility, maintains sufficient color contrast, and supports screen readers effectively. The identified areas for improvement are relatively minor and would further enhance the component's accessibility.

## Recommendations

1. Add `aria-live="polite"` to the submission count badge
2. Implement internationalization for text strings
3. Consider adding skip navigation for keyboard users
4. Document accessibility features in component documentation
5. Include accessibility testing in the component's test suite
