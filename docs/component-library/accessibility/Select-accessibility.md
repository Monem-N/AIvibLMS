## Recommendations for Improvement

1. Add support for option groups (optgroup) for better organization of options
2. Implement a custom dropdown that allows for more complex option rendering
3. Add support for multi-select functionality
4. Improve contrast ratio of helper text to meet AAA standards

## Testing Methodology

Testing was conducted using:
- Manual keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader testing with NVDA on Windows and VoiceOver on macOS
- Color contrast analysis using the WebAIM Contrast Checker
- Automated accessibility testing using axe-core

## Conclusion

The Select component meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards and provides a good accessible experience. It uses proper semantic HTML, includes appropriate ARIA attributes, and provides clear visual and programmatic indication of states such as focus, error, and disabled. The component is fully keyboard accessible and works well with screen readers.

Some minor improvements could be made to enhance the accessibility further, particularly around option grouping and contrast ratios, but these are not critical issues and do not prevent users with disabilities from using the component effectively.
