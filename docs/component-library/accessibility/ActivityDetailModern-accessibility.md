| Focus management | 2.4.3 Focus Order | Medium | Implement proper focus management when navigating between activities | Planned for v2.3.0 |

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. Add `aria-live="polite"` to the activity content area for dynamic content updates
2. Add `aria-busy="true"` during loading states
3. Add `role="main"` to the main content container
4. Implement proper focus management when navigating between activities
5. Add `aria-current="page"` to the current activity in navigation
6. Ensure all child components follow accessibility best practices
7. Add skip links for keyboard users to bypass navigation

## Testing Methodology

Testing was conducted using:
- Manual keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader testing with NVDA on Windows and VoiceOver on macOS
- Color contrast analysis using the WebAIM Contrast Checker
- Automated accessibility testing using axe-core

## Conclusion

The ActivityDetailModern component partially meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards. It provides good keyboard accessibility and uses semantic HTML, but has some accessibility issues that should be addressed in future releases:

1. The component lacks proper ARIA attributes for screen readers, which makes it difficult for screen reader users to understand dynamic content updates.
2. Focus management needs improvement when navigating between activities.

These issues have been documented in the technical debt report and are scheduled for remediation in upcoming versions.
