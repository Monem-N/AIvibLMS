# ActivityNavigation - Accessibility Compliance Report

**Date:** 2025-04-25

## Compliance Summary

The `ActivityNavigation` component aims to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Based on initial analysis:

*   **Keyboard Navigation:** Generally compliant via standard link behavior.
*   **Screen Reader Support:** Generally compliant, link text provides context. Icon meaning needs verification.
*   **ARIA Attributes:** Basic compliance. Potential improvements: `aria-current`, `aria-disabled`.
*   **Color Contrast:** Requires verification against specific theme colors.
*   **Focus Management:** Relies on standard browser behavior. Focus visibility needs verification.

## Detailed Checklist (WCAG 2.1 AA)

| **Perceivable**  |                                           |               |                                                                                                                                     |
| 1.1 Text Alt     | Non-text Content                          | Needs Review  | Activity type icons need appropriate text alternatives (e.g., `aria-label`) if they convey unique information.                      |
| 1.3 Adaptable    | Info and Relationships                    | Compliant     | Uses standard HTML structure.                                                                                                       |
| 1.4 Distinguishable| Use of Color                              | Needs Review  | Ensure color is not the *only* means of conveying information (e.g., disabled state uses opacity, not just color).                |
|                  | Contrast (Minimum)                        | Needs Review  | Verify text/icon contrast against backgrounds (`#f9f9f9`, `white`) and link hover states meet 4.5:1 ratio.                         |
| **Operable**     |                                           |               |                                                                                                                                     |
| 2.1 Keyboard Acc | Keyboard                                  | Compliant     | All interactive elements (links) are keyboard accessible.                                                                           |
| 2.4 Navigable    | Focus Order                               | Compliant     | Focus order follows logical DOM order.                                                                                              |
|                  | Link Purpose (In Context)                 | Compliant     | Link text (activity title, "Previous", "Next", "Back to Course") generally describes the destination.                               |
|                  | Headings and Labels                       | Compliant     | Uses descriptive labels ("Previous", "Next"). `<h3>` used for title.                                                               |
| 2.5 Input Modalities | Target Size                             | Needs Review  | Ensure link target sizes are adequate, especially on touch devices.                                                                 |
| **Understandable**|                                           |               |                                                                                                                                     |
| 3.2 Predictable  | Consistent Navigation                     | Compliant     | Provides consistent navigation pattern within activities.                                                                           |
| **Robust**       |                                           |               |                                                                                                                                     |
| 4.1 Compatible   | Parsing                                   | Compliant     | Uses valid HTML/JSX.                                                                                                                |
|                  | Name, Role, Value                         | Needs Review  | Consider adding `aria-disabled="true"` to the `div` elements used for disabled links for better semantic communication.             |

## Recommendations

1.  **Icon Accessibility:** Add `aria-hidden="true"` if icons are purely decorative OR provide meaningful `aria-label` if they convey unique type information not in adjacent text.
2.  **Contrast Check:** Perform automated and manual contrast checks with the specific color palette used.
3.  **Disabled State:** Add `aria-disabled="true"` to the container `div` elements that replace the `<Link>` for disabled states.
4.  **Target Size:** Verify clickable areas meet minimum size recommendations (e.g., 44x44 CSS pixels).
