## Identified Issues and Remediation

| Issue | WCAG Criterion | Severity | Remediation Plan | Status |
|-------|----------------|----------|------------------|--------|
| Color alone used to distinguish notification types | 1.4.1 Use of Color | Medium | Add additional visual cues (patterns, icons) | Planned for v2.3.0 |
| Focus management with multiple notifications | 2.4.3 Focus Order | High | Implement proper focus management | Planned for v2.2.0 |
| Small touch targets | 2.5.5 Target Size | Medium | Increase size of dismiss button | Planned for v2.3.0 |

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. Add additional visual cues beyond color to distinguish notification types
2. Implement proper focus management when multiple notifications appear
3. Increase the size of the dismiss button to meet touch target size requirements
4. Add a notification count when multiple notifications are stacked
5. Add support for high contrast mode
6. Ensure RTL language support is properly implemented

## Testing Methodology

Testing was conducted using:
- Manual keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader testing with NVDA on Windows and VoiceOver on macOS
- Color contrast analysis using the WebAIM Contrast Checker
- Automated accessibility testing using axe-core

## Conclusion

The NotificationModern component largely meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards. It provides good keyboard accessibility and screen reader support through appropriate ARIA attributes. However, there are a few accessibility issues that should be addressed in future releases:

1. The component relies on color alone to distinguish between notification types, which may be difficult for users with color vision deficiencies.
2. The component does not properly manage focus when multiple notifications appear, which may confuse screen reader users.
3. The dismiss button is smaller than the recommended touch target size, which may make it difficult for users with motor impairments to activate.

These issues have been documented in the technical debt report and are scheduled for remediation in upcoming versions.
