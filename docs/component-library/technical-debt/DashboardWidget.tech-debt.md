# Technical Debt Report for DashboardWidget

## TODOs

-   [ ] Add unit tests for the component.
-   [ ] Implement proper error handling for the `onRefresh` function.
-   [ ] Investigate the possibility of using a more flexible styling solution (e.g., styled-components).

## Refactor Needs

-   The component could be refactored to use a more generic approach for handling loading and error states.
-   The CSS could be improved to be more modular and maintainable.

## Known Limitations

-   The component does not currently support server-side rendering.
-   The component does not provide any built-in accessibility features beyond the basic structure.
