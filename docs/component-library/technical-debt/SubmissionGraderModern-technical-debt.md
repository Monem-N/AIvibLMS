# Technical Debt Report: SubmissionGraderModern

## Known Issues

1. **Hardcoded Strings**: Some strings in the component are hardcoded and not internationalized.
2. **Error Handling**: Limited error handling for network failures.
3. **Styling**: Inline styles are used in some places, which should be moved to CSS/SCSS files.

## Refactor Recommendations

1. Use a localization library for all user-facing strings.
2. Implement a retry mechanism for network requests.
3. Refactor inline styles into a dedicated CSS/SCSS file.

## TODOs

- [ ] Add unit tests for edge cases.
- [ ] Improve documentation for props and state management.
- [ ] Optimize performance for large submissions.
