# Technical Debt Report: ForgotPasswordModern Component

## Overview

This report summarizes the identified technical debt within the `ForgotPasswordModern` component. Addressing these items will improve the component's maintainability, testability, and adherence to best practices.

## Identified Technical Debt

### 1. Limited Input Validation

-   **Description**: The current implementation only checks if the email input is empty. More robust validation (e.g., email format) is handled by the browser and the backend service.
-   **Impact**: Potential for submitting invalid email formats, relying solely on backend error handling for user feedback.
-   **Mitigation**: Implement client-side email format validation before submitting the form.

### 2. Error Handling Granularity

-   **Description**: Generic error handling in the `handleSubmit` catch block. Specific error types from the `resetPassword` call are not explicitly handled (e.g., user not found, rate limiting).
-   **Impact**: Less specific user feedback in case of different error scenarios.
-   **Mitigation**: Refine error handling to provide more specific messages based on the error received from the `useAuth` hook.

### 3. Lack of Unit Tests

-   **Description**: No dedicated unit tests found for the `ForgotPasswordModern` component.
-   **Impact**: Reduced confidence in component behavior, increased risk of regressions when making changes.
-   **Mitigation**: Write comprehensive unit tests covering different states (initial, submitting, submitted), user interactions, and error scenarios.

## Recommendations

-   Implement client-side email format validation.
-   Improve error handling to provide more specific user feedback.
-   Develop comprehensive unit tests for the component.

## Prioritization

-   **High**: Lack of Unit Tests (essential for maintainability and preventing regressions)
-   **Medium**: Error Handling Granularity (improves user experience)
-   **Low**: Limited Input Validation (basic validation is present, but could be more robust)
