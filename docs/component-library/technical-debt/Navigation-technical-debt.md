# Technical Debt Review for Navigation

## Summary

| Category | Count | Severity | Overall Impact |
|----------|-------|----------|----------------|
| Legacy Patterns | 2 | Medium | Medium |
| Code Quality Issues | 3 | Low-Medium | Medium |
| Performance Issues | 1 | Low | Low |
| Accessibility Issues | 1 | Medium | Medium |
| **Total** | **7** | **Medium** | **Medium** |

## Legacy Patterns

| ID | Pattern | Description | Impact | Remediation | Priority |
|----|---------|-------------|--------|-------------|----------|
| LP-001 | Direct DOM Manipulation | Uses direct DOM manipulation with classList instead of React state | Makes component behavior less predictable and harder to test | Refactor to use React state for UI changes | Medium |
| LP-002 | CSS File Import | Uses imported CSS file instead of styled-components | Reduces component encapsulation and increases risk of style conflicts | Migrate to styled-components for consistent styling approach | Medium |

## Deprecated Props

| ID | Prop | Version Deprecated | Replacement | Migration Path | Breaking Change |
|----|------|-------------------|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |

## Required Future Optimizations

| ID | Optimization | Description | Benefit | Complexity | Priority |
|----|--------------|-------------|---------|------------|----------|
| RFO-001 | Navigation Context | Create a NavigationContext to avoid prop drilling | Simplifies component usage and improves maintainability | Medium | Medium |
| RFO-002 | Navigation Item Component | Extract navigation item rendering to a separate component | Improves code organization and testability | Low | Medium |

## Code Quality Issues

| ID | Issue | Description | Impact | Remediation | Priority |
|----|-------|-------------|--------|-------------|----------|
| CQ-001 | Any Type Usage | Uses `any` type for icon props | Reduces type safety and IDE support | Replace with proper SVG component type | Low |
| CQ-002 | Hardcoded Values | Contains hardcoded values for permission levels | Makes component less configurable | Extract to constants or configuration | Low |
| CQ-003 | Complex Rendering Logic | Navigation item rendering logic is complex and nested | Makes the component harder to understand and maintain | Extract to smaller, focused components | Medium |

## Performance Issues

| ID | Issue | Description | Impact | Remediation | Priority |
|----|-------|-------------|--------|-------------|----------|
| PI-001 | Unnecessary Re-renders | Component may re-render unnecessarily when props change | Minor performance impact, especially with large navigation structures | Implement React.memo and optimize dependency arrays | Low |

## Accessibility Issues

| ID | Issue | WCAG Criterion | Impact | Remediation | Priority |
|----|-------|----------------|--------|-------------|----------|
| AI-001 | Keyboard Navigation | 2.1.1 Keyboard | Limited keyboard navigation between nested menu items | Implement arrow key navigation within menu levels | Medium |

## Severity Definitions

| Severity | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| **High** | Critical issues that significantly impact maintainability, performance, or user experience. Should be addressed in the next release. |
| **Medium** | Important issues that have moderate impact. Should be addressed in the next few releases. |
| **Low** | Minor issues with limited impact. Can be addressed when convenient or as part of larger refactoring efforts. |

## Priority Definitions

| Priority | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| **High** | Should be addressed as soon as possible, ideally in the next sprint. |
| **Medium** | Should be addressed in the next 2-3 sprints. |
| **Low** | Can be addressed when convenient or as part of larger refactoring efforts. |
