# Technical Debt Report for ProtectedRoute Component

## Summary

This report outlines the technical debt associated with the `ProtectedRoute` component.

## Areas of Concern

-   **Lack of Unit Tests**: The component currently lacks unit tests, making it difficult to ensure its correctness and prevent regressions.
-   **Tight Coupling**: The component is tightly coupled with the `useAuthContext` hook, making it difficult to test and reuse in isolation.
-   **Loading State**: The loading state is very basic and could be improved with a more visually appealing loading indicator.

## Proposed Solutions

-   **Implement Unit Tests**: Write unit tests to cover the component's functionality, including its redirection logic and email verification check.
-   **Decouple from useAuthContext**: Decouple the component from the `useAuthContext` hook by using a more generic authentication interface.
-   **Improve Loading State**: Implement a more visually appealing loading indicator.

## Estimated Effort

-   **Unit Tests**: 4 hours
-   **Decoupling**: 8 hours
-   **Improve Loading State**: 2 hours
