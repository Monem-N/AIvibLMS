# SubmissionContent Component Technical Debt Report

## Known Limitations

1. File Type Support
   - Limited preview support for certain file types
   - No built-in viewer for specialized file formats
   - Potential performance issues with large file attachments

2. Accessibility Gaps
   - Need enhanced screen reader support for file type indicators
   - Keyboard navigation improvements needed for attachment list
   - Missing ARIA labels for dynamic content

3. Performance Considerations
   - Large attachment lists may impact rendering performance
   - File size calculation could be optimized
   - Potential memory leaks in attachment cleanup

## TODOs

### High Priority
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for attachment previews
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling for failed downloads
- [ ] Enhance keyboard navigation patterns

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Add support for additional file formats
- [ ] Implement file type validation
- [ ] Create loading states for attachment processing

### Low Priority
- [ ] Add file compression options
- [ ] Implement batch download functionality
- [ ] Add drag-and-drop reordering of attachments

## Refactoring Needs

1. Code Structure
   - Extract file type handling into separate utility
   - Implement proper TypeScript interfaces
   - Separate attachment rendering logic

2. Testing Coverage
   - Add unit tests for file size formatting
   - Implement integration tests for attachment handling
   - Add accessibility testing suite

3. Documentation
   - Update prop types documentation
   - Add performance optimization guide
   - Document error handling patterns

## Future Considerations

1. Feature Enhancements
   - Built-in file preview system
   - Progress indicators for downloads
   - Advanced file organization options

2. Technical Improvements
   - Migration to Web Components
   - Implementation of virtual scrolling
   - Enhanced caching mechanisms

## Version Impact

Current technical debt does not significantly impact the component's core functionality but should be addressed for future scalability and maintainability.

## Resolution Timeline

- Q1: Address high-priority items
- Q2: Implement medium-priority features
