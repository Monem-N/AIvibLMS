# ActivityNavigation - Technical Debt Report

**Date:** 2025-04-25

## Identified Technical Debt

*   **(Placeholder)** Potential reliance on specific Redux state structure (`state.activities`). Changes to the store shape might require updates here.
*   **(Placeholder)** Error handling for the `fetchModuleActivities` action could be more robust within the component or handled globally.
*   **(Placeholder)** Lack of dedicated unit/integration tests for this component.

## Proposed Actions

*   **(Placeholder)** Consider adding selectors with memoization to decouple the component further from the raw state structure.
*   **(Placeholder)** Implement local error handling or ensure global error handling covers API failures for activity fetching.
*   **(Placeholder)** Add tests covering various scenarios (loading, first/last activity, activity not found, API error).

## Severity Assessment

*   **(Placeholder)** Current debt level: Low-Medium. The component functions but lacks robustness and test coverage.
