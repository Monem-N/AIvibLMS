# Component Technical Debt Review Template

This template provides a structured format for documenting technical debt in components. Use this template when conducting technical debt reviews as part of the component documentation process.

| CO-001 | Code Quality Issues: Magic Numbers | Low | 0.5-1 day | Next major | None |


### Migration Guide for Deprecated Features

```jsx
// Old usage (deprecated)
<ComponentName deprecatedProp="value" />

// New usage (recommended)
<ComponentName newProp="value" />
```

### Additional Notes

This technical debt analysis was automatically generated based on static code analysis. It may not capture all technical debt issues, and some identified issues may be false positives. Please review and validate each issue before addressing it.

The component was analyzed on 2025-04-25.

## Severity Definitions

| Severity | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| **High** | Critical issues that significantly impact maintainability, performance, or user experience. Should be addressed in the next release. |
| **Medium** | Important issues that have moderate impact. Should be addressed in the next few releases. |
| **Low** | Minor issues with limited impact. Can be addressed when convenient or as part of larger refactoring efforts. |

## Priority Definitions

| Priority | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| **High** | Should be addressed as soon as possible, ideally in the next sprint. |
| **Medium** | Should be addressed in the next 2-3 sprints. |
| **Low** | Can be addressed when convenient or as part of larger refactoring efforts. |

## Technical Debt Review Process

1. **Identify**: Review component code and identify technical debt issues
2. **Categorize**: Categorize issues by type (legacy patterns, deprecated props, etc.)
3. **Assess**: Determine severity and priority for each issue
4. **Document**: Document issues using this template
5. **Plan**: Create a roadmap for addressing the technical debt
6. **Track**: Add issues to the project tracking system with appropriate labels

## Common Technical Debt Patterns to Look For

### Legacy Patterns

- Direct DOM manipulation instead of React patterns
- Class components that could be functional components
- Mixins or higher-order components that could use hooks
- Prop drilling instead of context or state management
- Inline styles instead of styled components or CSS modules
- Imperative code instead of declarative patterns

### Deprecated Props and APIs

- Props that have been replaced by newer alternatives
- Usage of deprecated React lifecycle methods
- Usage of deprecated DOM APIs
- Usage of deprecated third-party library APIs
- Usage of deprecated browser APIs

### Performance Issues

- Unnecessary re-renders
- Missing memoization
- Inefficient rendering patterns
- Large component bundles
- Expensive calculations in render methods
- Inefficient state updates

### Code Quality Issues

- Duplicated code
- Overly complex components
- Poor separation of concerns
- Inconsistent naming conventions
- Inadequate error handling
- Missing or outdated tests
- Inadequate documentation

### Accessibility Issues

- Missing ARIA attributes
- Improper semantic HTML
- Keyboard navigation issues
- Color contrast issues
- Screen reader compatibility issues
