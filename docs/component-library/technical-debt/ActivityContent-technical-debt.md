## Summary

| Category | Count | Severity | Overall Impact |
|----------|-------|----------|----------------|
| Legacy Patterns | 2 | Medium | Medium |
| Code Quality Issues | 2 | Low-Medium | Medium |
| Performance Issues | 1 | Low | Low |
| **Total** | **5** | **Medium** | **Medium** |

## Legacy Patterns

| ID | Pattern | Description | Impact | Remediation | Priority |
|----|---------|-------------|--------|-------------|----------|
| LP-001 | CSS File Import | Uses imported CSS file instead of styled-components | Reduces component encapsulation and increases risk of style conflicts | Migrate to styled-components for consistent styling approach | Medium |
| LP-002 | Inline SVG Icons | Contains hardcoded SVG icons instead of using an icon component | Makes maintenance difficult and increases bundle size | Extract to a reusable Icon component | Medium |

## Deprecated Props

| ID | Prop | Version Deprecated | Replacement | Migration Path | Breaking Change |
|----|------|-------------------|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |

## Required Future Optimizations

| ID | Optimization | Description | Benefit | Complexity | Priority |
|----|--------------|-------------|---------|------------|----------|
| RFO-001 | Component Splitting | Split into smaller sub-components for each activity type | Improves code organization and testability | Medium | Medium |
| RFO-002 | Memoization | Add memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders | Improves performance | Low | Low |

## Code Quality Issues

| ID | Issue | Description | Impact | Remediation | Priority |
|----|-------|-------------|--------|-------------|----------|
| CQ-001 | Hardcoded Strings | Contains hardcoded strings for labels and messages | Makes internationalization difficult | Extract to constants or i18n system | Low |
| CQ-002 | Hardcoded Quiz Info | Quiz information (time limit, attempts) is hardcoded | Makes the component less reusable | Move to props or activity data model | Medium |

## Performance Issues

| ID | Issue | Description | Impact | Remediation | Priority |
|----|-------|-------------|--------|-------------|----------|
| PI-001 | Unnecessary Re-renders | Component may re-render unnecessarily when props change | Minor performance impact, especially with complex markdown content | Implement React.memo and optimize dependency arrays | Low |

## Accessibility Issues

| ID | Issue | WCAG Criterion | Impact | Remediation | Priority |
|----|-------|----------------|--------|-------------|----------|
| N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
