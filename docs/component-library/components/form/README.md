## Form Design Principles

Form components follow these design principles:

1. **Usability**: Forms are designed to be easy to use and understand
2. **Validation**: Forms provide clear validation feedback
3. **Accessibility**: Forms are accessible to all users
4. **Consistency**: Forms maintain consistent styling and behavior
5. **Efficiency**: Forms minimize user effort

## Form Validation

Form validation follows these guidelines:

- Validate input in real-time where appropriate
- Provide clear error messages
- Indicate required fields
- Prevent submission of invalid forms
- Preserve user input during validation

## Accessibility Considerations

Form components are designed with the following accessibility considerations:

- All form fields have associated labels
- Error messages are linked to form fields
- Form fields can be navigated using keyboard
- Form fields have appropriate ARIA attributes
- Color is not the only means of conveying information
