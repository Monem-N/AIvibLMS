# GradingFilters Component

## Introduction
The GradingFilters component provides filter controls for the grading dashboard, allowing instructors to filter student submissions by module, activity type, status, and search terms. This component is essential for managing large numbers of submissions and helps instructors focus on specific subsets of work that need attention.

## Features
- **Module Filter**: Filter submissions by course module
- **Activity Type Filter**: Filter by assignment, quiz, or discussion
- **Status Filter**: Filter by submission status (pending, graded, all)
- **Search Filter**: Search submissions by student name or activity title
- **Clear All**: Reset all filters with a single click
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on mobile and desktop devices
- Filter by module, activity type, status, and search terms
- Clear all filters with single click
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Props
### Props Table
| Prop | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|------|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| course | Course | - | Yes | The course object containing modules and activities |
| filters | Object | - | Yes | Current filter values |
| onFilterChange | Function | - | Yes | Callback when filters change |

### Prop Details
- **course**: The complete course object containing all modules and activities
- **filters**: Current filter values including moduleId, activityType, status, and search term
- **onFilterChange**: Callback function that receives updated filter values
```typescript
interface GradingFiltersProps {
  course: Course;
  filters: {
    moduleId: string;
    activityType: string;
    status: string;
    search: string;
  };
  onFilterChange: (filters: any) => void;
}
```

## Usage
### Basic Usage
```typescript
import GradingFilters from '@components/grading/GradingFilters';

const GradingDashboard = () => {
  const [filters, setFilters] = useState({
    moduleId: '',
    activityType: '',
    status: 'pending',
    search: ''
  });

  return (
    <GradingFilters
      course={course}
      filters={filters}
      onFilterChange={setFilters}
    />
  );
};
```

### Advanced Usage
```typescript
// Example with custom filter persistence
const [filters, setFilters] = useLocalStorage('gradingFilters', initialFilters);

// Example with debounced search
const handleSearchChange = useDebouncedCallback((value) => {
  setFilters(prev => ({...prev, search: value}));
}, 300);
```typescript
import GradingFilters from '@components/grading/GradingFilters';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [filters, setFilters] = useState({ /* initial filters */ });

  return (
    <GradingFilters 
      course={course} 
      filters={filters} 
      onFilterChange={setFilters} 
    />
  );
};
```

## Accessibility
