## Contingency Plans for Critical Path Items

| ID | Action Item | Risk | Contingency Plan |
|----|------------|------|------------------|
| CP-01 | Begin Discussion Forums milestone | Resource availability | Reallocate resources from non-critical tasks, adjust scope |
| CP-02 | Contract additional Frontend Developer | Hiring challenges | Engage with multiple recruiting channels, consider remote options |
| CP-03 | Conduct technical spike for Notification System | Technical complexity | Allocate additional time, engage external expertise if needed |
| CP-04 | Develop component library documentation | Resource constraints | Prioritize critical components, phase documentation effort |
| CP-05 | Plan Mobile App architecture | Knowledge gaps | Engage external consultant, conduct training sessions |

## Action Item Tracking Process

1. **Weekly Review**
   - Review action item status in weekly project meetings
   - Update status and identify blockers
   - Adjust priorities and due dates as needed

2. **Monthly Assessment**
   - Comprehensive review of all action items
   - Evaluate impact on project timeline and quality
   - Identify new action items based on project progress

3. **Quarterly Planning**
   - Strategic review of action items
   - Align with project goals and milestones
   - Adjust resource allocation as needed

## Next Steps

1. Communicate action items to respective owners
2. Establish tracking mechanism in project management tool
3. Begin weekly review process
4. Prioritize critical path items for immediate action
