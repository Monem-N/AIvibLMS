| **Low (1)**          | 1       | 2          | 3        |

**Risk Score Interpretation:**
- 1-2: Low Risk - Monitor
- 3-4: Medium Risk - Plan mitigation
- 6-9: High Risk - Immediate action required

## Risk Management Process

1. **Risk Identification**
   - Regular risk identification sessions with the project team
   - Stakeholder input on potential risks
   - Technical review of implementation plans

2. **Risk Assessment**
   - Evaluation of probability and impact
   - Calculation of risk score
   - Prioritization based on score

3. **Risk Mitigation**
   - Development of mitigation strategies
   - Assignment of risk owners
   - Implementation of mitigation actions

4. **Risk Monitoring**
   - Regular review of risk status
   - Tracking of mitigation progress
   - Identification of new risks

5. **Risk Closure**
   - Verification of risk resolution
   - Documentation of lessons learned
   - Closure of resolved risks
