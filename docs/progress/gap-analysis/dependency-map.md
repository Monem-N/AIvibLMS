## Critical Path Analysis

The critical path for the Hypatia LMS modernization project is:

1. Authentication System
2. Dashboard Modernization
3. Course Detail Pages
4. Activity Detail Pages
5. Course Editor
6. Grading System
7. Discussion Forums
8. Notification System
9. User Profile Management
10. Analytics Dashboard
11. Mobile App

Any delay in these milestones will directly impact the project timeline.

## Dependency Bottlenecks

| Bottleneck | Description | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------------|-------------|--------|---------------------|

| React Component Reusability | Dependency on common components across features | Medium | Develop a component library with clear documentation |
| Testing Dependencies | Test coverage dependencies on component implementation | Medium | Implement test-driven development approach |
| Browser Compatibility | Dependency on modern browser features | Medium | Implement feature detection and graceful degradation |
| Developer Knowledge | Dependency on developer familiarity with modern technologies | Medium | Provide training, documentation, and pair programming |

## Dependency Risk Assessment

| Dependency Risk | Probability | Impact | Risk Score | Mitigation Strategy |
|-----------------|------------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| Firebase service disruption | Low | High | 3 | Implement offline capabilities and synchronization |
| Third-party library breaking changes | Medium | Medium | 4 | Lock versions, comprehensive testing before upgrades |
| Browser compatibility issues | Medium | Medium | 4 | Cross-browser testing, polyfills, feature detection |
| Resource availability for critical path items | Medium | High | 6 | Resource planning, cross-training team members |
| Integration issues between components | Medium | High | 6 | Comprehensive integration testing, clear interfaces |

## Dependency Management Process

1. **Dependency Identification**
   - Identify dependencies during planning phase
   - Document dependencies in the dependency map
   - Classify dependencies by type and impact

2. **Dependency Analysis**
   - Analyze critical path dependencies
   - Identify potential bottlenecks
   - Assess dependency risks

3. **Dependency Mitigation**
   - Develop mitigation strategies for high-risk dependencies
   - Implement technical solutions to reduce dependency impact
   - Plan work sequencing to manage dependencies

4. **Dependency Monitoring**
   - Regularly review dependency status
   - Track changes to external dependencies
   - Update dependency map as project evolves

5. **Dependency Resolution**
   - Address dependency issues promptly
   - Communicate dependency changes to stakeholders
   - Document lessons learned for future projects

## Next Steps

1. Review and update dependency map after each milestone completion
2. Conduct detailed dependency analysis for upcoming Discussion Forums milestone
3. Develop mitigation strategies for identified dependency bottlenecks
4. Monitor external dependencies for changes or updates
5. Communicate critical dependencies to all stakeholders
