# Security Implementation

This document provides an overview of the security implementation for the Hypatia LMS system, focusing on the changes made to address the critical security vulnerabilities identified in the Modernization Review.

## Database Security Rules

We have implemented granular security rules for Firebase Realtime Database to restrict access based on authentication and authorization. The rules are defined in `firebase/database.rules.json` and enforce the following principles:

1. **Authentication Required**: All read and write operations require authentication
2. **Role-Based Access Control**: Access to resources is restricted based on user roles and permissions
3. **Resource Ownership**: Users can access their own resources, while administrators have broader access
4. **Least Privilege**: Users are granted the minimum permissions necessary for their role

Example rule for user data:

```json
"users": {
  "$uid": {
    ".read": "auth.uid == $uid || root.child('users').child(auth.uid).child('info/level').val() >= 5",
    ".write": "auth.uid == $uid || root.child('users').child(auth.uid).child('info/level').val() >= 5"
  }
}
```

This rule ensures that users can only read and write their own data, while administrators (level 5) can access all user data.

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

We have implemented RBAC using Firebase Authentication custom claims. The implementation consists of:

1. **Custom Claims**: User roles and permissions are stored as custom claims in the Firebase Authentication token
2. **Cloud Function**: A Cloud Function (`setUserClaims`) updates custom claims when user information changes
3. **Permission Checking**: Utility functions check permissions based on custom claims
4. **Protected Routes**: React components restrict access to routes based on permissions

The following roles are defined:

| Role | Level | Permissions |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Admin | 5+ | read:all, write:all, manage:users, manage:courses, manage:content, manage:system |
| Instructor | 4+ | read:all, write:courses, manage:content, grade:assignments, create:courses |
| Assistant | 3+ | read:all, write:content, grade:assignments |
| Moderator | 2+ | read:all, moderate:content |
| Student | 1+ | read:own |

## Authentication Flow

The authentication flow is implemented using Firebase Authentication and custom React hooks:

1. **User Registration**: Users register with email and password
2. **User Login**: Users log in with email and password
3. **Custom Claims**: Custom claims are set based on user level
4. **Token Verification**: Custom claims are verified on the client side
5. **Permission Checking**: Permissions are checked for protected routes and actions

## Route Protection

Routes are protected using the `ProtectedRoute` component, which checks authentication and authorization:

```jsx
<Route 
  path="/admin" 
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute roles="admin">
      <AdminDashboard />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  } 
/>
```

This ensures that only users with the appropriate role or permission can access protected routes.

## Component-Level Authorization

Components check permissions before rendering actions or content:

```jsx
const canEdit = hasPermission(user, 'write:courses') || isOwner(user, course.createdBy);

{canEdit && (
  <Link to={`/courses/${course.id}/edit`} className="btn btn-primary">
    Edit Course
  </Link>
)}
```

This ensures that users only see actions they are authorized to perform.

## Security Best Practices

In addition to the specific implementations above, we follow these security best practices:

1. **Input Validation**: All user input is validated before processing
2. **Output Encoding**: All user-generated content is properly encoded before display
3. **HTTPS**: All communication is encrypted using HTTPS
4. **Secure Headers**: Security headers are set to prevent common attacks
5. **Content Security Policy**: CSP is implemented to prevent XSS attacks
6. **Dependency Scanning**: Dependencies are regularly scanned for vulnerabilities
7. **Security Monitoring**: Security events are logged and monitored

## Next Steps

The following security enhancements are planned:

1. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Add support for MFA
2. **Session Management**: Implement more robust session management
3. **Audit Logging**: Enhance logging for security-relevant events
4. **Penetration Testing**: Conduct regular penetration testing
5. **Security Training**: Provide security training for developers
