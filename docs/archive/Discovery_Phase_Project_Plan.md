3. Architecture design is complete and validated
4. Technology selections are finalized with clear rationale
5. Project infrastructure is set up and ready for development
6. Implementation plan for the Core Framework phase is approved

## Next Steps

Based on the Modernization Review findings, we have adjusted our approach to prioritize critical issues. Upon completion of the Discovery phase, the project will transition to the following phases:

### 1. Security First Initiative (Immediate Priority)

- Update Firebase database security rules
- Implement basic RBAC in Firebase Authentication
- Address high-priority XSS vulnerabilities
- Add security scanning to development process
- Complete implementation of Authentication and Authorization (ADR-007)

### 2. Technical Debt Reduction (High Priority)

- Create component inventory and modernization tracking
- Begin converting class components to functional components
- Start removing jQuery dependencies
- Implement TypeScript in new components
- Create migration guides for developers

### 3. Testing Implementation (High Priority)

- Set up testing framework (Jest, React Testing Library)
- Create test templates and guidelines
- Begin writing tests for critical components
- Set up CI integration for testing
- Establish testing culture and practices

### 4. Core Framework Implementation

- Implement the application foundation
- Set up state management
- Create the UI component library
- Implement authentication and authorization
- Create the service layer foundation

### 5. DevOps and Infrastructure

- Set up CI/CD pipeline
- Configure development, staging, and production environments
- Implement monitoring and alerting
- Set up automated deployments
- Create infrastructure as code

These adjusted next steps reflect our commitment to addressing the critical issues identified in the Modernization Review while maintaining progress toward our overall modernization goals.
