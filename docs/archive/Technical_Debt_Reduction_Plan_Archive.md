# [ARCHIVED] Technical Debt Reduction Plan

> **Note**: This document is from the initial planning phase of the modernization project (July 2023).
> The goals outlined here have been accomplished. See the current document
> `Modernization_Status_and_Future_Plans.md` for up-to-date information.

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy and specific actions to address the significant technical debt identified in the Modernization Review. The plan focuses on modernizing React components, removing jQuery dependencies, implementing TypeScript, and establishing best practices for future development.

## Current Technical Debt Assessment

Based on the Modernization Review findings:

1. **React Component Structure**:
   - 92% of components are still class-based (138/150 components)
   - Only 8% have been converted to functional components with hooks (12/150 components)

2. **jQuery Dependencies**:
   - jQuery is used in 78 files throughout the codebase
   - Many components mix React with jQuery DOM manipulation

3. **TypeScript Adoption**:
   - 0% TypeScript coverage
   - No type definitions for components or data models

4. **Code Quality**:
   - Inconsistent coding patterns
   - Limited documentation
   - No standardized component structure

## Technical Debt Reduction Goals

| Metric | Current | 30-Day Target | 90-Day Target |
|--------|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Functional Components | 8% (12/150) | 30% (45/150) | 70% (105/150) |
| jQuery Files | 78 | 50 | 0 |
| TypeScript Coverage | 0% | 20% | 60% |
| Component Documentation | 5% | 30% | 80% |
| Code Quality Score | C- | B- | A- |
