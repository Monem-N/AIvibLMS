## Usability Testing

| Test Area | Description | Considerations |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Dashboard Usability | Evaluate ease of understanding dashboards | Test with users from different roles (admin, instructor, student) |
| Report Configuration | Test ease of creating and configuring reports | Evaluate intuitiveness of report builder interface |
| Data Exploration | Evaluate ease of exploring and analyzing data | Test drill-down capabilities and data discovery workflows |
| Filter Interaction | Test usability of filtering controls | Evaluate clarity and ease of use for different filter types |
| Mobile Experience | Test analytics on mobile devices | Verify usability on different screen sizes and touch interfaces |
| Accessibility | Test compliance with accessibility standards | Verify screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation |
| Internationalization | Test with different languages and locales | Verify date formats, number formatting, and translations |

## Integration Testing

| Test Area | Description | Considerations |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Data Flow | Test end-to-end data flow from events to reports | Verify data integrity throughout the analytics pipeline |
| API Integration | Test analytics API endpoints | Verify correct data retrieval and manipulation via API |
| Authentication Integration | Test authentication with analytics features | Verify proper authorization checks and token handling |
| Export Integration | Test integration with export services | Verify proper handling of different export formats |
| Email Integration | Test scheduled report delivery | Verify email formatting and delivery reliability |
| External Tool Integration | Test integration with external analytics tools | Verify data consistency across integrated systems |

## Security Testing

| Test Area | Description | Considerations |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Data Access Controls | Test enforcement of access permissions | Verify users can only access authorized data |
| PII Protection | Test handling of personally identifiable information | Verify anonymization and privacy controls |
| API Security | Test security of analytics API endpoints | Verify proper authentication and authorization checks |
| Export Security | Test security of exported data | Verify sensitive data handling in exports |
| SQL Injection | Test resistance to injection attacks | Verify input sanitization in query parameters |
| Cross-Site Scripting | Test XSS vulnerabilities in dashboards | Verify proper escaping of user-generated content |

## Data Integrity Testing

| Test Area | Description | Considerations |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Data Consistency | Verify consistency across different views | Compare data between reports, dashboards, and raw sources |
| Aggregation Accuracy | Test accuracy of data aggregations | Verify that aggregated metrics match raw data calculations |
| Time-based Calculations | Test date and time-based metrics | Verify handling of different time zones and date ranges |
| Edge Cases | Test handling of edge cases | Verify behavior with empty data sets, outliers, and boundary values |
| Data Retention | Test data retention policies | Verify proper application of retention rules |
| Data Recovery | Test recovery from failures | Verify data integrity after system failures or interruptions |

## Automated Testing Approaches

| Test Type | Tools | Implementation |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| Unit Tests | Jest, Testing Library | Test individual calculation functions and components |
| Integration Tests | Cypress, Playwright | Test end-to-end workflows and data flow |
| API Tests | Supertest, Postman | Test API endpoints and responses |
| Performance Tests | k6, Lighthouse | Measure response times and loading performance |
| Visual Regression | Percy, Chromatic | Detect visual changes in dashboards and reports |
| Accessibility Tests | axe, Lighthouse | Verify accessibility compliance |

## Test Data Considerations

- Create comprehensive test data sets that cover various scenarios
- Include edge cases such as empty courses, inactive users, and partial completions
- Generate synthetic data for performance testing with realistic volumes
- Create test data for different user roles and permission levels
- Develop test data that produces known analytical results for validation
- Consider privacy implications when using production data for testing
