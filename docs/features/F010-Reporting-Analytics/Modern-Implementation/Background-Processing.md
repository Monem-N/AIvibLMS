# Background Processing

The Background Processing module handles data aggregation, scheduled tasks, and other background operations for the analytics system in the Hypatia Modern LMS.

## Data Aggregation

The system performs regular data aggregation to optimize query performance for dashboards and reports.

```typescript
// src/services/analyticsAggregationService.ts
import { getFirestore, collection, query, where, getDocs } from 'firebase/firestore';
// Service implementation...
```

Key aggregation processes:
- Daily user activity aggregation
- Weekly and monthly course statistics
- Assessment performance metrics
- Content engagement statistics
- User progress summaries

## Scheduled Tasks

The system uses Firebase Cloud Functions to run scheduled tasks for analytics processing.

```typescript
// functions/src/scheduledTasks.ts
import * as functions from 'firebase-functions';
// Function implementation...
```

Key scheduled tasks:
- Daily data aggregation (runs at 2 AM)
- Weekly report generation (runs on Sundays)
- Monthly analytics summaries (runs on the 1st of each month)
- Data retention enforcement (runs weekly)
- System health checks (runs hourly)

## Report Generation

The background processing system handles automated report generation and delivery.

```typescript
// functions/src/reportGeneration.ts
import * as functions from 'firebase-functions';
// Function implementation...
```

Key report generation features:
- Scheduled report generation based on saved configurations
- PDF, Excel, and CSV export generation
- Email delivery of reports
- Report archiving and storage
- Failure handling and retry logic

## Data Processing Pipeline

The system implements a data processing pipeline for transforming raw analytics events into meaningful metrics.

```typescript
// functions/src/processingPipeline.ts
import * as functions from 'firebase-functions';
// Pipeline implementation...
```

Pipeline stages:
1. Event collection and validation
2. User activity correlation
3. Session analysis
4. Metric calculation
5. Aggregation and storage
6. Notification generation (for significant changes)

## Real-time Processing

The system supports real-time processing of analytics events for immediate dashboard updates.

```typescript
// functions/src/realtimeProcessing.ts
import * as functions from 'firebase-functions';
// Function implementation...
```

Key real-time processing features:
- Firestore triggers for event processing
- Immediate metric updates for critical events
- Real-time notification generation
- Streaming analytics for live dashboards

## Error Handling and Monitoring

The background processing system includes comprehensive error handling and monitoring.

```typescript
// functions/src/errorHandling.ts
import * as functions from 'firebase-functions';
// Function implementation...
```

Key error handling features:
- Automatic retry for transient failures
- Dead-letter queues for failed processing
- Error logging and alerting
- Processing status monitoring
- Recovery procedures for data inconsistencies

## Scaling Considerations

The background processing system is designed to scale with increasing data volumes.

```typescript
// functions/src/index.ts
import * as functions from 'firebase-functions';
// Function configuration...
```

Key scaling features:
- Distributed processing for large datasets
- Batched operations for efficient database access
- Incremental processing for large historical datasets
- Resource allocation based on workload
- Throttling to prevent system overload
