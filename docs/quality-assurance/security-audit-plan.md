# Security Audit Plan

**Action Item:** HP-06: Conduct Security Audit  
**Priority:** High  
**Owner:** Security Lead  
**Due Date:** 2023-09-15  
**Status:** Not Started

## Objective

Conduct a comprehensive security audit of the Hypatia LMS modernization project to identify vulnerabilities, assess compliance with security standards, and implement necessary security controls to protect user data and system integrity.

## Background

The Hypatia LMS modernization project has completed six major milestones and is now handling sensitive user data, including personal information, academic records, and authentication credentials. As the system approaches production readiness, it is critical to ensure that appropriate security measures are in place to protect against common threats and vulnerabilities.

A thorough security audit will help identify potential security issues before they can be exploited, ensure compliance with relevant regulations (such as FERPA for educational data), and establish a security baseline for ongoing monitoring and improvement.
