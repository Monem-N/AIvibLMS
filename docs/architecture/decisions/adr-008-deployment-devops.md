# ADR 008: Deployment and DevOps Strategy

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The modernization of the Hypatia LMS requires a robust deployment and DevOps strategy to ensure reliable, consistent, and efficient delivery of the application. The current system lacks a formalized deployment process and automated CI/CD pipeline, which has led to inconsistent deployments and manual testing processes.

We need to establish a comprehensive approach to deployment, continuous integration, continuous delivery, infrastructure management, monitoring, and operational support that aligns with modern best practices while considering the specific needs of an educational platform.

Key considerations include:

- Deployment environments (development, staging, production)
- Continuous integration and delivery processes
- Infrastructure provisioning and management
- Monitoring and observability
- Backup and disaster recovery
- Security and compliance
- Cost optimization
- Developer experience
- Operational support

## Decision

We will implement a cloud-based DevOps strategy with the following components:

1. **Deployment Environments**:
   - Development: For ongoing development and testing
   - Staging: For pre-production validation
   - Production: For end-user access

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - GitHub Actions for continuous integration
   - Automated testing at multiple levels (unit, integration, e2e)
   - Automated deployment to Firebase Hosting and Cloud Functions

3. **Infrastructure as Code**:
   - Firebase configuration managed with Firebase CLI
   - Infrastructure defined using Terraform for any additional cloud resources
   - Environment-specific configuration managed through GitHub Environments

4. **Containerization**:
   - Docker for local development consistency
   - Container-based CI/CD processes

5. **Monitoring and Observability**:
   - Firebase Performance Monitoring for frontend performance
   - Firebase Crashlytics for error tracking
   - Google Cloud Monitoring for backend services
   - Custom application logging with structured logs

6. **Backup and Disaster Recovery**:
   - Automated Firestore backups
   - Multi-region database configuration
   - Documented recovery procedures

7. **Security**:
   - Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Regular security audits
   - Compliance with educational data protection standards

## Rationale

This approach was selected for the following reasons:

1. **Cloud-Native Integration**: Leveraging Firebase and Google Cloud Platform provides tight integration with our chosen backend services, simplifying the operational model.

2. **Automation First**: Automating the deployment pipeline reduces human error, increases deployment frequency, and improves reliability.

3. **Infrastructure as Code**: Managing infrastructure through code ensures consistency across environments, enables version control of infrastructure changes, and facilitates disaster recovery.

4. **Developer Experience**: GitHub Actions provides a familiar environment for developers, reducing the learning curve and improving adoption.

5. **Scalability**: The selected tools and platforms can scale with the application as it grows in usage and complexity.

6. **Cost Efficiency**: Firebase and GCP offer pay-as-you-go pricing models that align costs with actual usage, with free tiers for development and testing.

7. **Comprehensive Monitoring**: The combination of Firebase and GCP monitoring tools provides visibility into all aspects of the application, from frontend performance to backend health.

8. **Security Integration**: Built-in security features and integrations with security scanning tools ensure that security is addressed throughout the development lifecycle.

Alternative approaches considered:

1. **Self-hosted Infrastructure**: Traditional server-based deployment would provide more control but at the cost of increased operational complexity and maintenance overhead.

2. **AWS-based Deployment**: AWS offers a comprehensive set of services but would introduce additional complexity when integrating with Firebase services.

3. **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)**: Solutions like Heroku would simplify deployment but might limit flexibility and increase costs at scale.

4. **Manual Deployment Process**: Continuing with manual deployments would be simpler initially but would not address the current challenges with consistency and reliability.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Consistent, reliable deployments across environments
- Reduced time from code commit to production
- Improved quality through automated testing
- Better visibility into application performance and issues
- Reduced operational overhead through automation
- Enhanced security through automated scanning and audits
- Improved disaster recovery capabilities
- Better alignment with modern development practices

### Negative

- Initial setup time and learning curve for the development team
- Potential for increased complexity in the development workflow
- Dependency on cloud providers and their service availability
- Need for ongoing maintenance of CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure code
- Potential cost increases for advanced monitoring and high-traffic scenarios

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Initial Setup (Week 1-2)**:
   - Configure GitHub repository with branch protection rules
   - Set up GitHub Actions for CI with basic linting and testing
   - Create development, staging, and production Firebase projects
   - Implement basic Firebase deployment workflow

2. **Testing Integration (Week 3-4)**:
   - Integrate unit testing in CI pipeline
   - Set up integration testing environment
   - Configure end-to-end testing with Cypress or Playwright
   - Implement test coverage reporting

3. **Environment Configuration (Week 5-6)**:
   - Set up environment-specific configurations
   - Implement secrets management
   - Configure staging environment to mirror production
   - Create Terraform configurations for additional resources

4. **Monitoring Setup (Week 7-8)**:
   - Implement application logging strategy
   - Configure Firebase Performance Monitoring
   - Set up error tracking with Crashlytics
   - Create monitoring dashboards and alerts

5. **Security and Compliance (Week 9-10)**:
   - Integrate dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Implement security scanning in CI pipeline
   - Document security practices and compliance measures
   - Conduct initial security audit

6. **Documentation and Training (Week 11-12)**:
   - Create comprehensive DevOps documentation
   - Document disaster recovery procedures
   - Conduct team training on the new processes
   - Perform mock disaster recovery exercise

## Monitoring and Success Metrics

We will track the following metrics to evaluate the success of our DevOps strategy:

1. **Deployment Frequency**: How often we can deploy to production
2. **Lead Time for Changes**: Time from code commit to production deployment
3. **Change Failure Rate**: Percentage of deployments causing incidents
4. **Mean Time to Recovery**: Time to recover from incidents
5. **Test Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by automated tests
6. **Build Success Rate**: Percentage of successful CI builds
7. **Performance Metrics**: Page load times, API response times, etc.
8. **Error Rates**: Number of errors in production
9. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Number and severity of identified vulnerabilities
10. **Cost Efficiency**: Cloud resource costs relative to application usage

## Alternatives Considered

### Self-hosted Infrastructure

- **Pros**: Complete control over infrastructure, potential cost savings for high-traffic scenarios
- **Cons**: Higher operational overhead, requires specialized DevOps expertise, less integration with Firebase services

### AWS-based Deployment

- **Pros**: Comprehensive service offerings, mature tooling, extensive documentation
- **Cons**: More complex integration with Firebase, potential for higher costs, steeper learning curve

### Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)

- **Pros**: Simplicity of deployment, reduced operational overhead, focus on application code
- **Cons**: Less flexibility, potential vendor lock-in, higher costs at scale, limited integration with Firebase

### Manual Deployment Process

- **Pros**: Simplicity, minimal initial setup, familiar to team
- **Cons**: Error-prone, time-consuming, limited scalability, poor visibility into issues
