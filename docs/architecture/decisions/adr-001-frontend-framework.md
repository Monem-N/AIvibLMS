# ADR 001: Frontend Framework Selection

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The modernization of the Hypatia LMS requires selecting a frontend framework that will serve as the foundation for the new system. The current implementation uses React with class components, Redux for state management, and React Router for navigation, along with jQuery for DOM manipulation. We need to decide whether to continue with React or consider alternative frameworks, and which version and patterns to adopt.

Key considerations include:

- Developer experience and productivity
- Performance characteristics
- Learning curve for the development team
- Ecosystem and community support
- Long-term viability
- Compatibility with existing skills and knowledge

## Decision

We will use React 18+ with functional components and hooks as the frontend framework for the modernized Hypatia LMS.

Specifically:

1. We will use functional components exclusively, avoiding class components
2. We will use React hooks for state management and side effects
3. We will use React Router v6+ for routing
4. We will eliminate jQuery dependencies in favor of native React patterns
5. We will use TypeScript for type safety

## Rationale

React was selected for the following reasons:

1. **Continuity with Existing System**: The current system already uses React, which provides some continuity and reduces the learning curve for developers familiar with the existing codebase.

2. **Modern React Patterns**: Functional components and hooks represent the current best practice in React development, offering a more concise and maintainable code style compared to class components.

3. **Performance**: React 18 includes significant performance improvements, including automatic batching of state updates and concurrent rendering capabilities.

4. **Ecosystem**: React has a vast ecosystem of libraries, tools, and community resources, which will accelerate development and help solve common challenges.

5. **Industry Adoption**: React remains one of the most widely adopted frontend frameworks, making it easier to find developers and resources.

6. **TypeScript Integration**: React works well with TypeScript, which will help improve code quality and developer experience.

7. **Incremental Adoption**: React allows for incremental adoption of new features and patterns, which aligns with our modernization approach.

Alternative frameworks considered:

1. **Vue.js**: While Vue offers excellent developer experience and performance, switching would require a complete rewrite and additional learning curve.

2. **Angular**: Angular provides a more opinionated, full-featured framework but would represent a more significant departure from the current architecture.

3. **Svelte**: Svelte offers excellent performance and a concise syntax but has a smaller ecosystem and would require a complete rewrite.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Leverages existing React knowledge while moving to modern patterns
- Improves code maintainability through functional components and hooks
- Enhances performance with React 18 features
- Provides a clear path for eliminating jQuery dependencies
- Enables better type safety with TypeScript

### Negative

- Requires refactoring existing class components to functional components
- May require additional training for developers not familiar with modern React patterns
- Some third-party libraries may not be fully compatible with React 18

## Alternatives Considered

### Vue.js

- **Pros**: Excellent documentation, gentle learning curve, good performance
- **Cons**: Complete rewrite required, smaller ecosystem than React

### Angular

- **Pros**: Comprehensive framework, strong typing with TypeScript
- **Cons**: Steeper learning curve, more opinionated, complete rewrite required

### Svelte

- **Pros**: Excellent performance, less boilerplate code
- **Cons**: Smaller ecosystem, fewer resources, complete rewrite required

### Keep React with Class Components

- **Pros**: Minimal changes to existing patterns
- **Cons**: Misses benefits of modern React, perpetuates technical debt
