# AIvibLMS Architecture

## Overview

AIvibLMS is a modern Learning Management System built with React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. It uses a microservices architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability.

## System Components

### Frontend

- **UI Layer**: React components with a responsive design
- **State Management**: Redux for global state management
- **Routing**: React Router for navigation
- **API Integration**: Axios for API calls

### Backend

- **API Gateway**: Express.js server that routes requests to appropriate microservices
- **Authentication Service**: Handles user authentication and authorization
- **Course Service**: Manages course creation, updates, and retrieval
- **User Service**: Handles user profiles and settings
- **Content Service**: Manages learning materials and resources
- **Assessment Service**: Handles quizzes, assignments, and grading

### Database

- **Primary Database**: MongoDB for flexible document storage
- **Cache Layer**: Redis for performance optimization

### Infrastructure

- **Containerization**: Docker for consistent environments
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for container management
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment

## Data Flow

1. User interacts with the React frontend
2. Frontend makes API calls to the backend services
3. Backend services process requests and interact with the database
4. Results are returned to the frontend for display

## Security Considerations

- JWT for authentication
- HTTPS for all communications
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Regular security audits
