# Logging and Monitoring Improvement Plan

**Action Item:** MP-04: Improve Logging and Monitoring  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Owner:** DevOps Lead  
**Due Date:** 2023-10-30

## Logging Standards

### Log Levels

1. **ERROR**: Errors that prevent the application from functioning correctly
2. **WARN**: Potentially harmful situations that don't prevent the application from working
3. **INFO**: Informational messages that highlight application progress
4. **DEBUG**: Detailed information useful for debugging
5. **TRACE**: Very detailed information, typically only enabled during development

### Log Categories

1. **SYSTEM**: System-level events (startup, shutdown, configuration)
2. **SECURITY**: Authentication, authorization, and security-related events
3. **PERFORMANCE**: Performance metrics and timings
4. **USER**: User actions and behavior
5. **DATA**: Data access and modification events
6. **INTEGRATION**: External system interactions
7. **ERROR**: Error and exception events

### Log Format

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-10-01T12:34:56.789Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "category": "USER",
  "message": "User completed course module",
  "context": {
    "userId": "user123",
    "courseId": "course456",
    "moduleId": "module789"
  },
  "traceId": "abc123def456",
  "source": {
    "service": "course-service",
    "file": "courseController.js",
    "function": "completeModule",
    "line": 123
  },
  "environment": "production"
}
```

## Alerting Strategy

### Alert Priorities

1. **P1 (Critical)**: Immediate action required, system down or severely impacted

|--------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
| Error Rate | >1% | >5% | P2 |
| API Latency | >500ms | >2000ms | P3 |
| CPU Usage | >70% | >90% | P3 |
| Memory Usage | >80% | >95% | P3 |
| Disk Usage | >80% | >95% | P3 |
| Failed Logins | >10/min | >50/min | P2 |
| Database Connections | >80% | >95% | P2 |
| 5xx Errors | >0 | >10/min | P1 |

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Performance impact of logging | Medium | Medium | Optimize logging code, use sampling for high-volume events |
| Log volume management | High | Medium | Implement log rotation and retention policies, use log levels effectively |
| Alert fatigue | High | Medium | Carefully tune alert thresholds, implement alert grouping and routing |
| Privacy concerns | Medium | High | Anonymize sensitive data, implement access controls for logs |
| Integration complexity | Medium | Medium | Start with core functionality, implement incrementally |

## Maintenance Plan

- Review and adjust log levels periodically
- Tune alert thresholds based on operational experience
- Archive historical logs and metrics
