# Technical Documentation Update Plan

**Action Item:** HP-07: Update Technical Documentation  
**Priority:** High  
**Owner:** Technical Writer  
**Due Date:** 2023-09-30  
**Status:** Not Started

## Objective

Update and enhance the technical documentation for the Hypatia LMS modernization project to ensure it accurately reflects the current architecture, implementation details, and development practices for all completed milestones.

## Background

The Hypatia LMS modernization project has completed six major milestones (Authentication System, Dashboard, Course Detail Pages, Activity Detail Pages, Course Editor, and Grading System). While some documentation exists, it has not been consistently updated to reflect the evolving architecture and implementation details. Comprehensive and up-to-date technical documentation is essential for:

- Onboarding new team members
- Maintaining and extending existing features
- Troubleshooting issues
- Ensuring architectural consistency
- Supporting knowledge transfer

  - Staging environment
  - Monitoring and logging
  - Backup and recovery

### Phase 6: Review and Publication (Week 4: Sep 28-30)

- **Task 6.1:** Conduct technical review
  - Review by technical leads
  - Verify accuracy and completeness
  - Address feedback
  
- **Task 6.2:** Organize documentation
  - Create documentation portal
  - Implement search functionality

## Resource Requirements

- Technical Writer: 40 hours
- Technical Lead: 16 hours
- Frontend Lead: 12 hours
- Backend Lead: 12 hours
- DevOps Lead: 8 hours
- QA Lead: 8 hours

## Success Criteria

- Documentation covers all completed milestones
- Architecture documentation is complete and accurate
- Feature implementation details are documented
- Development guides are comprehensive and practical
- Documentation is accessible and searchable
- Team members can successfully use documentation for development and troubleshooting

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Knowledge gaps | Medium | High | Interview key developers, review code, conduct architecture sessions |
| Resource constraints | Medium | Medium | Prioritize critical documentation, distribute tasks |
| Technical complexity | Medium | Medium | Involve subject matter experts, use diagrams and examples |
| Documentation drift | High | Medium | Establish documentation update process, integrate with development workflow |
| Low adoption | Medium | High | Make documentation easily accessible, promote usage, gather feedback |

## Maintenance Plan

- Assign documentation ownership to feature owners
- Include documentation updates in definition of done for features
- Conduct quarterly documentation reviews
- Track documentation usage and gather feedback
- Implement continuous improvement process
